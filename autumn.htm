<h3>
Grey Autumn</h3>
a short song cycle
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Autumn Comes In</h4>

<p><br>Watch this pomergarante sunset
<br>Shine on cobwebbed pine.
<br>Violins usher in
<br>A colder day.
<br>Swirling leaves around my doorstep,
<br>The days grow shorter,
<br>the shadows grow longer.
<p>Pull out this plum jacket,
<br>Bundle myself in.
<br>White noise ushers in
<br>A sparkling night.
<br>Spiders spin in my corner,
<br>The distance grows longer,
<br>The debts pile higher.
<p>I need to find something
<br>That survives the seasons
<br>Before I die.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Sunday</h4>

<p><br>The heat got shut off
<br>On cold, rainy Sunday.
<br>Dead leaves get stuck in gutters,
<br>sucked in.
<br>The paint falls off,
<br>But I'm holding to these four walls,
<br>Holding to these four walls.
<p>My only friends are the spiders in the corner.
<br>They're the only ones I'm not too broke to see.
<br>Orbs and domes all over the ceiling
<br>In a gray room,
<br>Grayer than outside.
<p>There's no gold in autumn,
<br>No cream for me.
<br>Shades of sky and mud clog the room
<br>Like gutters.
<br>Full of dust and cobwebs,
<br>But I'm holding to these four walls,
<br>Holding to these four walls.
<p>My only friends are the spiders in the corner.
<br>They're the only ones I'm not too broke to see.
<br>Orbs and domes all over the ceiling
<br>In a gray room,
<br>Grayer than outside.
<p>Things are falling apart
<br>But I hold on
<br>Like a spider.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
The Last Rose of Summer</h4>

<p><br>Your eyes
<br>Like dark pools
<br>Full with fallen leaves.
<p>I cry
<br>Must pay my debts,
<br>Must move away from you.
<p>So I give the last rose of summer
<br>and the first fallen leaf of autumn.
<br>I will come back for you another season,
<br>I will come for you someday soon.
<p>This rose
<br>Color of sunshine,
<br>Glow like candle in flame.
<p>This leaf,
<br>Color of brass,
<br>Curl like a censer.
<p>So I give the last rose of summer
<br>And the first fallen leaf of autumn.
<br>I will come back for you another season,
<br>I will come for you someday soon.
<p>Once I said I'd never fall in love
<br>Because people never love me back.
<br>But when someone does love me back,
<br>I can't stay for long
<br>Because of my mistakes.
<p>So I give the last rose of summer
<br>And the first fallen leaf of autumn.
<br>I will come back for you another season,
<br>I will come for you someday soon.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
New Years</h4>

<p><br>It's the same year on repeat for me,
<br>A few Halloween parties,
<br>A few Rosh Hashana apples,
<br>Can't fast
<br>When no one cares if I do
<br>There's nothing for me here.
<br>There's no new year for me here.
<p>I can't explain the distance
<br>between me and others.
<br>I can't explain why.
<br>I either believe in
<br>too much or
<br>believe in nothing.
<p>I make the same mistakes
<br>While the time grows shorter,
<br>Where's my new year?
<p>I fear whispers,
<br>No one could accept me,
<br>Where's my new year?
<p>I can't explain,
<br>why I am not casting my lot.
<br>I just wonder
<br>where's my new year?
<p>Where's my New Year?
