<P>Dyslexia and second language reading: A Literature Review, by Tara Edwards</P>
<P>The roots of dyslexia are much studied, as is the process of second language acquisition. It is generally assumed, however, with the phonological deficit that is found in most forms of dyslexia, reading in a second language is difficult at best. One study found some cases of dyslexic adult learners preferring to read in their second language, and tested them on reading speed. What were the results? What other factors influence both dyslexia and second language reading? Is it just phonological deficit? </P>
<P>For the purposes of the paper, while the discussion is on developmental dyslexia, I will also use research related to acquired dyslexia, following most researchers' focus on relating processes in developmental dyslexia in what they found. </P>
<P>Rayner and Pollatsek warn against finding a single 'cause' for developmental dyslexia, noting the findings and refutations of three different suspected causes. They made a list of types of dyslexia based on predominant symptoms. Much of the research, however, focuses on phonologically related types of dyslexia, both developmental and acquired.</P>
<P>This paper takes form as a literature review, gathering journal and book articles about second language reading and learning, different types of acquired and developmental dyslexia and possible causes. While most have human subjects, two of them feature models of adult and child reading, and attempts to introduce dyslexia in those models. More importantly, two studies that seems to refute notions of second languages reading being hard for dyslexics were found, one examining a woman with acquired surface dyslexia, and another examining Swedish adults with developmental dyslexia. </P>
<P>Finally, this paper will examine what it could mean for second language learning for dyslexics. Is it possible? Are there languages that are 'best' for dyslexics?</P>
<P>Dyslexia is the inability to read according to intellectual age, not explained by income, home life, emotional factors, motivation, or handicaps of vision, hearing, or movement. Rayner and Pollestek think that the problem with much of the research is that studies may lump poor readers (whose reading can be explained by one or more factors listed) with dyslexics, and that the research is focused on finding a single 'cause' for a single dyslexia. While dyslexia is useful as a marker, there may be different types of dyslexia, and many causes of dyslexia (Rayner and Polletsek, 425).</P>
<P>According to Holmes, some developmental dyslexics have similar sets of symptoms to acquired surface dyslexia (better at reading regular words, phonic reading, and homophone confusion errors). Jorm proposes that some developmental dyslexics have the same symptoms as acquired deep dyslexia (slower and less accurate with psuedowords, semantic mistakes, better at reading concrete, imagable words, some visual and semantic visual mistakes). Temple and Marshall made a similar proposal with acquired phonological dyslexia (serious problems with novel words, visual mistakes, and comfort with regular and irregular words).</P>
<P>Other studies find other types of dyslexia by symptom. Cited by Rayner, Boder divides the group between those with weaknesses in auditory skills who read words as whole (dysphonetic) and those with weaknesses in discrimination and analysis of visual gestalts of words who go through the labor of sounding out even familiar words (dyseidetic). Mitterer made a similar distinction in his group. Neuropsychologists further divide dyslexics by language deficit dyslexia (trouble with finding names of objects, with syntax, and with rapid verbal tasks) and visual-spatial dyslexia (finger agnosia, directional disorientation, and atypical handwriting orientation). The erratic eye movement studied by Palivides could also categorize visual-spatial dyslexia.</P>
<P>Recent research focuses on phonological awareness deficit as the cause of some, if not all, developmental dyslexias. Maggie Bruck's study comparing child and adult dyslexic readers finds that while adult readers do improve their reading and word scores, along with onset-rime awareness and orthographical sensitivity (as evidence by phoneme counting and deletion errors), poor scores in phonology and orthography continue through life (889-90). This gives some evidence for a persistent phonological block. More research examining the phonological awareness deficit will be discussed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Other studies </P>
<P>Some of the second language reading studies quoted here focus on written language, grammar, and intelligibility, particularly focusing on syntactical, not phonological aspects. Much of what can be learned from these studies is the acquisition process of a normal second language reading. Perhaps, it is close to the learning process of a dyslexic adult with some comfort with word recognition. Whether that is true is unknown.</P>
<P>A major hypothesis in the study of second language learning is the input hypothesis, which says "[a] necessary, but not sufficient, condition to move from stage I [current competence] to stage I + 1, where 'understand' means that the acquirer is focused on the meaning and not the form of the message (Lee, 33)." The underlying assumption in that is "the more comprehensible the input, the more acquisition would take place (Lee, 33)." That led second language researchers to ask about the relationship between understanding the prepositional content of input and using the forms to build and generalize about a linguistics system. The question Lee asks specifically is "what do language learners do with the morphological richness of the input? Do they use it to construct meaning . . .? Do they use it to construct form-meaning connections . . .? (Lee, 35)" </P>
<P>Lee answers that question by showing Spanish language learners three types of sentences: with the infinitive, with the subjunctive, and with an invented verb form (verb + -u ending), formed according to the morphological and syntactical rules of Spanish. He then asked the learners to recall as much as they can of what they read, main idea and details. Overall, they did better when recalling the infinitive and invented verb form than the subjunctive, and recalled more when a salesperson was mentioned in the passage than when it was not. However, "no significant correlation between recall and word recognition scores. Three other correlations between recall and word identification scores involving the separation of participants according to verb form also proved not to be significant. The final two correlations, involving recall and word recognition scores for those who did versus those who did not mention the salesperson in their recall, were also not significant. Taken together, this set of correlations suggest that the good comprehenders were not necessarily the good input processors (Lee, 41). </P>
<P>Lee's explanation for the verb-related scores, especially the high word identification score, was the relative complexity of the subjunctive to the infinitive and the regular invented verb form. It made it easier to spot, but harder to understand. With the recall scores of the people who mentioned the salesperson, Lee speculates that the readers organized their recalls around the rhetorical organization of the input passage. As he saw it, input processing was done through word identification, and comprehension was done through recall. Verb form and the mention of a salesperson affected comprehension; word identification was not. While for beginning language learners, there was no correlation, advanced language learners knew how use them to construct form-meaning connections, according to other studies. This may have implications for other features of a second language. </P>
<P>Dvorak investigated the relationship between second language written and oral language, asking if written language have characteristics that are not shared by oral language. "What is known about the differences in the form and structure of the language used in each context? (Dvorak, 79)" Research has shown while syntactical complexity in speech and writing increases in similar ways, children learning their first language adjust their speech to match their audience faster than adjusting their writing to their audience; what little research there is on second language suggests main clause + subordinate clause(s) length increases with language proficiency; and that second language learners are more talkative and accurate when they are talking about subjects they are interested in. The research in oral and written second language suggests that the complex sentence length tends to be longer in written language than spoken and "that written language tends to contain a higher percentage of adjective and adverb clauses than speech (Dvorak, 81)."</P>
<P>After asking Spanish-language students to both compose a story through pictures in speech and writing, and write an argumentative paper and speech, Dvorak compared the results, testing them on fluency, complexity, accuracy and elaboration. She also took note of reduced clauses such as gerund clauses, participle clauses, and prepositional clauses. </P>
<P>Some of the findings were expected: more proficiency in a second language lead to increased sentence complexity and increased accuracy in complex sentence. Students produced significantly more oral than written language on a topic, significantly fewer total errors in writing than speaking, and no significant difference between written and oral language in terms of syntactic complexity.</P>
<P>Syntactical complexity did vary between writing styles. At both low and high levels, differences between speech and writings were more significant for narration than for argumentation, with longer complex clauses and greater syntactical demands for argumentation; both students tend to use a greater proportion of simple sentences in writing than in speech. However, there is no difference in register between written and oral language in either argumentation or narration. As far as differences between high and low levels, low level students use more adjective clauses and less adverb clauses in writing than in speech, never used reduced clauses in speech, and only rarely in writing. Higher level students used the same amount of adverb clauses in writing and speech, but used fewer adjective clauses and many more reduced clauses in writing. "The speech of lower-level students was characterized by long strings held together by repeated use of <I>y;</I> when writing, these students tended to drop coordinating conjunction and chop their ideas into a series of simple sentences. The higher-level tend to use adjective clauses when speaking but switch to reduced clauses in writing (Dvorak, 86)." </P>
<P>In second language classes, it is common practice to teach all the rules of grammar in the target language in the first year, and then review them in the second. Looking at the Spanish subjunctive clauses, he questions Terrell, Baycroft, and Perrone ask are how accurate are the learners in using it, generalizing about its morphological and syntactical features, and do native speakers understand their use of it in speech? </P>
<P>Examining a Spanish class with heavy emphasis on conversation, students did well on the written exams. However, in the oral exams, the students used the subjunctive correctly only 22 percent of the time. This could be explain by students understanding the target language rules, but not acquiring them and applying them in a consistent manner. Some rules seem to be learned more quickly than others. "[P]reliminary work with rules such as person-number agreement in the present indicative, gender agreement, number agreement, and [other] rules that are expected to be acquired intuitively before the subjunctive, shows that they are used in spontaneous speech at much higher levels of accuracy than 10 percent (Terrell, Baycroft, Perrone, 23)." Perhaps this process is the same for all learners, independent of age, language background, and exposure to target language. The reason they see for the subjunctive inaccuracies are the confusion with the vowel switch rule and misuse of adverbial clauses like '<I>querer que</I>' and '<I>cuando</I>.'</P>
<P>For the second question, they asked native Spanish speakers about the student sentences. Preliminary studies indicate native German speakers tend to judge vocabulary errors as being more serious than grammatical errors and native Spanish speakers understand the intent of the sentence, no matter the grammatical errors. What the researchers found here was that no error was misunderstood by more than 30 percent of the native speakers. The most frequently misunderstood sentence was the 'main verb + <I>que</I> + dependent clause' form and errors in use of pronouns. Much like students, native speakers look not at verb forms, but at context to provide "the necessary semantic cues for compression (Terrell, Baycroft, Perrone, 27)." </P>
<P>Frantzen, et al examined Spanish-language compositions to see which points of grammar were understood the most accurately. They also wanted to see if students could accurately correct mistakes in grammar when given a chance. When writing compositions, the article features used with the highest level of accuracy were the definite masculine plural (<I>los</I>) and the definite masculine singular (<I>el</I>), and the indefinite masculine singular (<I>un</I>) but on the whole, all were easily correctable. As far as nouns and adjectives, the most accurate was the masculine singular, but the correction rate varied. Accuracy was highest in the indicative, person-verb inflection and the preterit/imperfect choice. Hardest to use accurate and correct were suffixes, regular stems, and irregular stems. As far as the <I>ser</I>/<I>estar </I>distinction, <I>ser </I>was used more accurately than <I>estar</I>, and the correction rate was very low. Indicative-for-subjunctive errors were not as correctable as subjunctive for indicative errors. Basically, the hardest to use accurately and correct was the use of estar and subjunctive use, while the easiest for accuracy and correction was los.</P>
<P>The authors conclude that the decision for self-correction in second language depended on binary choices (<I>estar</I> or <I>ser</I>? masculine or feminine?) of the language and tense, that acquiring number tense knowledge came before acquiring gender, and that second language learners pay the most attention to tense in verb formation. </P>
<P>Steffenson, et al, compared the reactions of bilingual readers to texts in English and Chinese. Ratings of the strength of imagery and affect in the two languages were identical, with similarities in number of reports, personal images and responses. Reading times, however, tend to be longer for the language they were least familiar with. This study suggests that universalities of images, feelings, and affect exist across linguistic groups. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Most of the research in dyslexia has been with English-speaking children, but some insights have been gleaned from dyslexic children speaking other languages, connectionist models, adults with acquired dyslexia, and even developmental dyslexic adults with a preference for another language.</P>
<P>First something that supports Brucks' research with categorial perception. Usually, dyslexia is divided between phonological and derivation problems. Some tests done by Serniclaes, et al, however, show that the surface profile almost disappears compared to the controls. In this study, the dyslexic subjects, both with phonological and surface dyslexia, were better at detecting within-category differences than between-category differences in sine wave sounds than normal reader normals. This is much like the less-sharp rate in categorial perception found by Brucks.</P>
<P>Mayringer and Wimmer decided to test the nature of the phonological learning deficit by not only have German-speaking dyslexic children name words quickly, but to learn three psuedowords associated with pictures, say them again, and repeat them after a slight delay. "Immediate repetition of the psuedonames posed no problem, but slightly delayed recall-after only one or two interposed other attempts-posed a major problem for dyslexic children (Wimmer, et al, as cited by Mayringer et al, 117)." Other studies document other problems with visual-verbal learning with difficulties in verbal short-term memory, rapid naming, phoneme segmentation, and possibly more serious deficits. The researchers felt that German, unlike English, had straightforward grapheme-phoneme relations, posing no conceivable problem with word recognition. In fact, some studies showed easier psuedoword recognition for German-speaking children than for English-speaking. German children are more accurate at phonological recoding, Perhaps, Mayringer, et al feels, the problem is a visual memory dysfunction, the inability to connect visual memory of words in print to the phoneme and meaning. </P>
<P>After testing different groups of boys with and without dyslexia, they found that immediate repetition of words were easy for both groups, along with a second presentation. However, when shown the psuedoword in print, the dyslexic group scored poorly in remembering the visual-verbal association. When the experiment was repeated a second time, the dyslexic groups' errors were found to be phonological distortions, while preserving the syllable structure. Even with other projects with varying syllable structures, the dyslexic deficit continued. Mayringer et al concluded that the deficit in new phonological form learning was a long-term memory deficit, possibly neurologically based. </P>
<P>Kremin, et al, studied a patient with a left-sided skull fracture named J.O. She can read word lists in her second language (English), but displays mostly visually related surface dyslexia and letter-by-letter reading when faced with word lists in her native French. What is interesting is that J.O. wasn't fluent in English, aside from school and some study-aboard. </P>
<P>Her I.Q. was normal, her "CT scan showed two regions of low attenuation, one in the insula and another in the superior posterior temporal region of the left hemisphere (Kremin, et al, 283)." She was fluent in speech, but had a naming deficit more severe with visual than verbal output. Word comprehension was better for concrete than abstract words; she was flawless at repeating words and psuedowords and could name individual letters, but her writing from dictation was impaired. </P>
<P>Her reading score for individual English words were much more accurate and faster than her reading score for individual French words, while she could recognize and understand word triads better in English than in French, though she did better in French word comprehension than in French word reading. Like surface dyslexics, she did better in understanding concrete and function words and psuedowords in French, but her scores in English were close to a normal reader. Reading time of words of the same length was also much faster in English than in French. Perhaps this is one example of the different localizations of first language and second language knowledge? </P>
<P>Harm and Seidenberg used the controversial method of simulating visual word recognition, normal and atypical word acquisition, and the effects of brain injury through computer models. A 1999 paper focused on learning to read. While they focus on the effects of literacy, the discussion will be about their modeling of phonological representation, learning to read, and developmental dyslexia.</P>
<P>Before phonological representation is discussed, it is best to explain some of the parts of the model.</P>
<P>Attractor architecture used the "distributed representation of phonemes in which units correspond to phonetic features (Harm and Seidenberg, 492)," that is 11 common phonetic features in consonants and vowels (labial, palatial, rounded, etc). All of the phonetic feature units were connected to each other and to a set of phonological cleanup units that incorporated known (English-language) phonemes and removed the rest. How the clean-up units decide that depends on phonological corpuses, lists of monosyllabic English words with common CVC patterns. The more the model reads, the more accurately it makes it decisions for word legitimacy. It allowed the model to fill in missing features and phonological segments much like a child learning to read. Some of the words, more frequent in English, used in the corpus appeared more than other words. </P>
<P>This network of phonological units formed what the researchers called basins of attraction. "[I]f one considers the 66 phonological features as forming a high dimensional space, with each feature representing one dimension, the trained network consists of a set of attractor states in that space. A point in space . . .will be subject to the network dynamics and pulled in various directions within the space. Those forces have the effect of limiting the regions in which the network can settle, such that noisy or degraded input is very likely to be coerced into a coherent pattern (Harm and Seidenberg, 497)." Think of it as word decisions represented as points on a graph, using the extremes of phonetic features rounded and radical.</P>
<P>Weights are the different mathematical equations the researchers gave to such factors as word frequency, uncertainty of phonetic feature distribution, and other decision factors. </P>
<P>Hidden processes intermediate between the phonological component of the model and the model of the spelling of the sound units, called the orthographic input units. Hidden processes are responsible for mapping the spelling of the word to its pronunciation.</P>
<P>Having the phonological attractor architecture made it easier to map spelling to sound. However, models without it picked up on words in the corpus and generalized about psuedowords just as well, due to rapid acquiring of the phonological knowledge needed. It, in short, affected the ability to generalize, not the ability to gain a finite reading vocabulary. They note that it is only a general idea of how a child learns to read. While the model assimilated a large corpus and may not know about phonological units beforehand, the child learns small vocabularies in time and has some phonetic training, through phonics-based reading instruction and emphasis on similarities in word rimes and onsets, and letter and phoneme pronunciation. However, there is some support for the better initial scores of the pre-trained model from findings that pre-readers "who have developed more segmental representation of phonological structure, as revealed by phonological tasks such as repeating a spoken word with a single phoneme deleted, show higher levels of reading ability in later grades (Adams, Share, et al., as cited by Harm and Seidenberg, 504).</P>
<P>With some insight into normal reading, Harm and Seidenberg decided to find out how to simulate observed features of developmental dyslexia, which they divided into phonological and surface. Much like recent research, they focus on phonological awareness impairment, and impair the phonological set to match observed features of dyslexic child reading, specifically poor scores on reading irregular words (mint vs. pint), psuedowords (vint), or both. They found that degrading the phonological representation caused the orthography-to-phonology part of the network to rely on orthographical knowledge heavily, impairing generalization. That impairment leads to poor scores on the psuedowords. The greater the impairment, the more the scores of exception words suffered as well. Simulating developmental surface dyslexia was more involved, with the researchers lowering the number of hidden units, giving the model a smaller training corpus, removing some weights, and putting more 'noise' in the weights. This resulted in delays in learning and generalizing about words, leading to poor scores on irregular words. This lead the researchers to concluded surface dyslexia and delayed reading could result from a shortage of neuro-computational resources, lack of reading experience, or failures to learn efficiently from experience. While the designation of the two types as surface and phonological come from the dual-route theory, the researchers feel that "[it] misses the similarity between these children's behavior and that of younger readers (poor scores in irregular words) and it does not derive from an impairment to a 'lexical' route (Harm and Seidenberg, 526)."</P>
<P>A similar study also using connectionist models was done by McLeod, Shallice and Plaut. Thanks to tests with a 'lesioned' (specifically, laterized damage) model learning new words, a model guessing at words with a mask and tests with normal readers trying to read degraded and masked versions of words, they suspect faulty attractors count for visual and semantic errors in deep dyslexic reading.</P>
<P>Through all this, researchers assume that reading competence is related to grammatical sensitivity and efficient mapping of spelling and sound, and reading skills in the first language are more efficient than in the second. Related to that, they assumed that deficits in first language reading would lead to limited interest and competence to outright avoidance of second language reading, especially related to reading anxiety. One study seems to blow away the idea that dyslexics avoid second language learning. Guron-Miller and Lundburg interviews and tests dyslexic Swedish adults that prefer reading in English, and have consistently performed better in English lessons than in Swedish. </P>
<P>They examine some possible reasons for this. First, Swedish children and young adults have "a considerable amount of input of spoken English through the television and popular music media (Guron-Miller and Lundburg, 43)," with subtitled American and British television and the adaptation of English vocabulary in technology, sports, music, information technology, and slang. Second, English language teaching emphases conversational fluency than reading, writing, and spelling. Third, teachers may have lowered expectations for the dyslexic student, letting them read at their own pace and select material they already have an interest in. Fourth, their hobbies, music, and possibility of overseas travel, gives them an incentive to become literate in a second language. </P>
<P>It is not just cultural and pedagogical factors, though. With dyslexic children who need to rely on contextual clues and parts of the words, especially the onset, English places less emphasis on phonological decoding (unlike Swedish and Hebrew) and more on deeper orthography and visual cues. It should be noted, however, that with the irregular phonology-orthography mapping of English, learning it as a second language could be a challenge for a child without much exposure to it. English also carries few demands in way of understanding and using inflection and derivation. It may have neurobiological bases, with second language and first language knowledge localized in different parts of the brain. </P>
<P>Guron-Miller and Lundberg compared dyslexics who prefer English to dyslexics who prefer Swedish and normal readers, examining phonological skill level (phonological choice task, non-word reading, and spoonerism task), orthographical development (orthographical choice, spelling task, and free writing), single word reading, oral reading of continuous texts, and reading comprehension.</P>
<P>While normal readers did better than the two groups of dyslexics, the main difference was between the dyslexics who prefer Swedish and the dyslexics who prefer English, with the English-preference group outperforming the Swedish-preference group in all 17 measures of English tasks. There was also an effect on Swedish, with deficits in Swedish reading by the Swedish-preference group not mirrored in the 12 matching tasks by the English-preference group. The effects of English on the tasks were higher among the Swedish-preferring dyslexics, and lowest among the English-preferring dyslexics, though there is "a considerable degree of variance of [English] word recognition skills and reading aptitude in the two dyslexic groups (Guron-Miller and Lundberg, 58)." Some dyslexics did much better in English than in Swedish, and some were less consistent. More accuracy in spelling individual English words, both isolated and in text, can be attributed to the deeper orthography strategy of English-preferring dyslexics, as opposed to the letter-by-letter strategy of Swedish-preferring dyslexics, or perhaps positive early experiences with English. A second language seems to give them new hope for reading: "It was like something positive happened when we were going to learn a new language (Guron-Miller, 59)." Perhaps the alternative to reducing or waiving requirements for a second language for dyslexics could be exposure to languages with deep orthography and less emphasis on phonological encoding. </P>
<P>Looking at these studies, which types of dyslexia seem adaptable to second language learning, what can second language learning research tell us about what dyslexic learners need, and what languages can dyslexics be most comfortable with? The verdict is still mixed; while dyslexics do better at reading different languages for different reasons, the deficits and their possible phonological root are still apparent. Perhaps the factors that made came up in second language recall-emotions, main ideas, rhetorical devises, verb tense and syntactical comprehension-could also help with reading deficits in a second, perhaps first language. Also, positive exposure to a second language, whether it is through hobbies or family language, could motivate the student for 'a second bite at the apple of literacy,' as Guron-Miller calls it. Before we can argue whether deep or shallow orthography is easier to learn, more attention and study to the different aspect of dyslexia, be it resembling surface, phonological, or more. We know that the easier syntactical aspects of a language to learn are the most frequent. In teaching a second language to dyslexic students, should the most attention be paid to familiarizing the student with that? In selecting passages about subjects that interest the student? What can researchers find out about American Sign Language and dyslexics? Does the long-term memory deficit exist in some children, and does it make it hard to map sign to meaning? Further research into the specific topic of dyslexics and a second language would be useful, in understanding both second language reading acquisition and blocks to it.</P>
