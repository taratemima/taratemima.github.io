<h3>Disclaimer for the Clowns de la Mort stories</h3>

These are works of fiction. The stories here are alternate universe 
slash
involving real people. Only few of the real people mentioned here were 
ever
in France during World War II. Misters Elfman and Burton were most
definitely not lovers in that period either. Probably weren't ever. I 
make
no guarantees about the personalities of the real people in the story. 
I
tried to stick to biography, interviews and little bits of trivia, but 
I
mostly made shit up.
<p>
I am also not making a profit from it. Nothing is stopping you from 
printing
it out and reading it on the train, saving a copy on your hard drive, 
etc.
Don't claim it is yours, though. It's just not something you do. 
<p>
Any mistakes about Paris or partisans or World War II are mine alone. A
biography and web pages used is on this page. If you have any 
suggestions
for further research, feel free.
<p>
These stories contain at least one of the following:

<ol>
<li>Male/male sex
<li>Male/female sex
<li>Swearing
<li>Violence, including mentions of the Holocaust. 
<li>Character death
<li>Angsty internal monologues 
<li>17-year-olds having sex with people their age and older. Age of 
consent is wonky, but I am going to assume they were closer to the UK age of
consent.
<li>Swearing
<li>Fangirl French and German
<li>God-awful in-jokes.
<li>Cute children and animals being menaced.
