RE:     [Maine] "Using" The Good Book<p>

Sender: owner-me-gaynet@abacus.oxy.edu<p>

Hi Tom... thanks for the info on The Good Book which interprets the bible in
a more humane and homophilic way.
<p>
I've been staging a series of weekly confrontations with evangelical types
at the University of Maine at Farmington.  
<p>
For the past several years, a very small cult calling themselves "Friends of
Christ" have been coming to the campus on whichever night the L/B/G/T
support group meets.  Truthfully, there are only four people in the cult,
and just two of them with huge, bellowing voices come out each week
recruiting our students.  Because they stand on the street, which is a
public thoroughfare, they are protected by their first amendment rights.
Even downtown merchants have tried to have them stopped from screaming at
shoppers on Saturdays, but to no legal avail.
<p>
The style of preaching is obnoxious... The couple dresses in grey wool
cloaks, somewhat similar to the kinds that the Puritans or Quakers might
have worn.  Locally, they are known as "The Grey People."  Although they
yell derogatory and defaming allegations at all students (we are all burning
in hell for our original and not-so-creative sins), one of the faves is
condemnation of homosexuality.  One year they were even allowed to rent a
table in the student center, just like any other vendors, and displayed a
huge banner claiming that "Homosexuality is an abomination."
<p>
I've been wanting to do something about this for a long time, as many
students have taken the evangelists' warnings personally, (especially women
who've been sexually molested and then told that they are whores for wearing
shorts).
<p>
Now, each week when the weather is dry, I throw on an elegant black cape
that I found at an antique shop, and with my bullhorn tucked inside the
cape, I head out onto the street to begin exercising MY first amendment
rights.  The first time I did it, there were not many people outside at
all... but just as I was wrapping up my "dress rehearsal" and making notes
for improving my shtick, a confluence of students emerging from the dining
hall and others leaving their classes formed a crowd of about 200... and so
I began reading again from a prepared statement on first amendment rights,
human dignity, and finished with excerpts from Michelangelo Signorile's
Queer Manifesto.  
<p>
The second week, many professors brought their classes outside to watch and
listen to the this street theatre, and in following weeks I've been asked to
address a variety of different classes to discuss gay rights, gay marriage,
and the university's new domestic partnership policy.
<p>
My goal with all of this is not to directly challenge the evangelists'
interpretations of the Bible... I don't expect to make a dent in their 
beliefs. 
I'm hoping to create some discussion of differing religious views, and
certainly to encourage more discussion of gay issues.  So far that's worked
very well.
<p>
Another goal is to encourage the evangelists to speak at a lower volume, and
to voice the loving rather than condemning and vengeful aspects of God.  So
far this seems to be happening also.
<p>
A third goal of making a public spectacle of myself on the street is to let
students have a reality check... until now, people scurry past the preachers
and say nothing to the insults and threats hurled at them.  My presence
makes it clear that at least one adult in the community disagrees with the
message and disapproves of the delivery of it.  
<p>
I used October to stage my own presentation for Gay History Month by
including information from the Alyson Almanac on prominent historical
figures who had ties to the sexual minorities.
<p>
Handouts that I prepared for these events included the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual
Students' Bill of Educational Rights (from Project 21), the Questionnaire
for Heterosexuals, and placards to hold reading "Preach, Don't Screech" and
"What Would Jesus Say?"
<p>
So far I've gotten mail and phone calls from students, faculty, and
community members who are supportive of the dialogue I've created.  I've
been painstakingly careful to assure students that I respect the evangelists
for the conviction of their faith that results in their persistence in the
face of humility and such... In turn, even the many students who think it's
funny or weird that I'm out there as the "Caped Avenger" have remembered my
sound bites about respect for others' views.  I've overheard many of them
talking about how weird the whole thing is, but they end up agreeing that
there isn't anything especially wrong with homosexuality.
<p>
With respect to The Good Book, there have been a flurry of calls from
Farmington area supporters who want me to come up with "evidence" from the
bible that they can use in defending gays at church discussions.  With the
advice that faith is a hard nut to crack, I offer some examples of these
biblical references, and remind these callers that the most they should
expect to accomplish is dialogue, not conversion.  Now I'll have another
resource to turn them on to!
<p>

And from another source:<br>
Comedian Lynn Lavner:  "The Bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals 
and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals.  That doesn't mean that God doesn't 
love heterosexuals.  It's just that they need more supervision."
