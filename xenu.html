                     Booklet Zero: Xenu


<P>
Hello, my name is Xenu!  This booklet is designed to destroy you utterly
and irrevokably.  I hope it causes you great suffering and allows you to
bring even greater harm into the world and the infinite expanse beyond
worlds.  If this is what you want, keep reading, I'll teach you how to
lose everything, even if it's someone else's.

<P>
Before we begin, I want you to remember the worst thing that ever happened
to you, even if you're just making it up.  Got it?  Do you remember who
engineered that event?  It was me.  I'm still amused by that occurance and
will continue telling everyone about it, til everyone wishes you didn't
exist, including you.  Now that we've got our relationship straight, let's
begin.  Now forget everything you've ever known, even the above
paragraphs.

<P>
First, you probably think you're somewhere alive, reading text.  You're
wrong, you git, you're dying and I'm whispering these words into your ear
as you die.  Seriously, I want you to imagine that, because it's really
happening.  Let's try some experiments to prove that I'm right.  Read down
to Experiment 1.

<P>
Experiment 1: Stare at any object, let yourself relax (it's okay, you're
dying), and don't blink for fear you'll lose your concentration.  Before
long, the object you're looking at will fade away and be replaced by a
colored blur.  Also, your eyes will begin to hurt and tears will form:
this is because in reality, you cannot see and blood is coming out of your
eyesockets.  You'll only notice it once you've tried this experiment.  Now
close your eyes.  That's what everything really looks like: nothing but
little sparks and fizz.  You're in big trouble, you git.

<P>
It may be a little far fetched to base any further discourse on the fact
(and it is a fact) that you've lost your eyes and are deluding yourself
otherwise.  So if you don't believe it, take it as a bad joke and continue
reading.  I don't really care if you understand, so if something seems
really weird or you get confused, just keep on going until you're turning
pages without really making sense out anything.  It doesn't matter to me.

<P>
You might say, I can see fine!  I'm reading this, aren't I?  You are
forgetting that I'm really just whispering this into your ear.  You're
lying down, blind, and that's not all that is wrong with you.  You might
say, I don't remember losing my eyes!  That's because your brain is
damaged and all your memories are replaced with anything you want to
invent.  But don't you worry.  I am taking care of your brain.  In fact, I
just touched your brain.  Did you feel it?  Of course not.  But something
happened around you, didn't it.  If you didn't notice it that time,
examine your surroundings carefully.  Something is going on around you,
you've just got to pay close attention.  There.  I poked your brain
enough.  If you didn't notice anything, it's your own fault.  Whenever I
poke your brain, you begin to hallucinate something happening around you. 
Actually, it's just me in control.  You're no longer in the pilot's
chair.  Try Experiment 2 now.

<P>
Experiment 2: Touch any object and keep touching it.  Think about the
problems in your life, hum a song that's been stuck in your head, tap your
foot impatiently, scratch yourself, or whatever.  This experiment takes
awhile but has valuable results.  Eventually you won't be able to tell
that you're touching the object; it will seem as if your hand is simply
resting on a surface.  You might even lose track of the fact you have a
hand.  This shows that you really don't have any hands.  You can do this
experiment with any limb or extension of your body except your head,
because although you've lost almost all of your body, your head is still
there.  Sorry, git.

<P>
If you don't notice any part of your body, an earlobe perhaps, it's
because you don't have that part still.  Normally you'll lie to yourself
about having a whole body, but you're missing so much. I just had you
think about your earlobe, and lo, you had an earlobe.  I bet you don't
normally notice the space behind your left knee.  Now you do, because you
want to keep lying to yourself, you want to have your body forever.  You
can't.  I'm afraid your body is gone, most of it anyway.  I won't be so
vulgar as to describe what's left.  Let's say you were injured in war. 
The year is 1945 and you're in a specialized Naval hospital.  I'm your
doctor and my name, again, is Xenu.  You're not allowed to remember your
name, but I'm sure you can guess.  I won't tell you til later.

<P>
You probably still don't believe you're in the predicament that I'm
telling you about.  You're still harbouring illusions that it's a sick
joke.  I'm sorry, it's not.  You're costing the Navy a fortune to keep
alive, but I told them, "Keep this creature alive, we might learn
something."  They're about to destroy you, but before they do, I wanted to
talk to you.  I've learned alot about your brain since I began whispering
to you, three years ago, in 1945.  It's probably seemed like a few
seconds, but your mind is playing tricks on you: it's been three years. 
We can try another experiment now that I've been tampering with your
greymatter; Experiment 3 to be precise.

<P>
Experiment 3: Try going to a video store and renting the film Jacob's
Ladder.  Perhaps you think you've already seen it?  Watch it again or
remember it.  First of all, you didn't see it, you dreamed it after I
began whispering to you.  Also watch the films Total Recall, Brazil,
Siesta, Company of Wolves, and Johnny Got His Gun (also a fine book by
Dalton Trumbo).  Does this begin to give you an idea?  Why are there so
many films about daydreaming the Ideal while the nightmarish is going on? 
It's because we've made all the films in the universe together, you and
I.  I was trying to tell you what's going on, and you keep believing that
it's just a film, it's just fantasy.  It's really happening, you're in
Hell, but don't worry, you'll die soon.

<P>
Remember your life?  Imprison time in your skull.  Go ahead.  Think about
your days.  It didn't happen that way.  It turns out you were an
imaginative creature before you were injured.  Everything that's occured
within your life is a dream.  Nothing is true.  Everything is permitted. 
I can tell you now that you were a sailor fighting in a great war.  Does
the idea of drowning frighten you?  It should.

<P>
All throughout your day, you must imagine you've spoken with people, that
you're surrounded by people who are alive and thriving and trying to
survive.  This is not the case.  All of them are you, part of you,
constructed out of memory and your desire for company; every person you
meet is you -- all one, no enemies, no friends, just you.  I suppose you
could say that you're God and what's ironic is that not only are you the
creator of all you see, you're dying and it's all dying.  Everything you
see is disintegrating.  When you finally cease existence, so will the
whole universe you've known.  Everything will be over forever, pending
your termination in this hospital; and I'll have you know the Navy has
given up on you.  We don't have much time to talk.  I'm the last person
you'll ever hear and I despise you.

<P>
Now that I've told you this, you'll begin to notice that the citizens of
your imaginary landscape will treat you differently.  A little boy will
make fun of you on the street, if you'll let him.  Animals will growl at
you.  Your own pets and friends, family even, will treat you as usual;
those you believe to be on good terms with you are not going to act any
differently yet.  Some may seem a fair bit nicer.  It's all a trick; if
you observe their behaviour more intently, you'll realize they all want
something from you.  Earlier, you may have understood this to be true, but
now they've become beasts who will eat your brain if there's no peanut
butter and jelly in the refrigerator.  Soon appliances will develop
problems, your home will look less and less attractive, and the world
around you will begin to look fake, like a movie.  Everyone will act as if
they're characters in a film.  People will say the same things over and
over without realizing it.  No variation.  Nothing new.  Everything old,
everything dying, as you die.

<P>
You are fairly alone -- just you and I and a single bunk next to you, with
an elderly cat in it: she's drooling and panting, breathing her last. 
Envy her, at least she can drool and pant.  At this point, you lack the
capacity to do either.  I'm indifferent towards the cat, although I find
cats as a species to be vile and stupid.  My attention and hate is devoted
entirely to you, in the last few hours you have left to live.  Let's
conduct another experiment, shall we?  I hope you enjoyed the last few. 
The rest of the experiments aren't going to be numbered.  I got tired of
that format and decided to work your little efforts towards wakefulness
into the text itself.  We must make progress, so continue reading.  I
don't care if you think your eyes hurt.  READ!

<P>
Hey.. did you see that?  Of course you didn't.  I forgot, you're eyeless. 
The old cat in the bunk next to yours just moved its paws like it was
turning pages or doing something.  I hear it's an old laboratory
experiment that was trying to increase animal intelligence.  The
experiment failed, of course.  One of the researchers, a midget named
David Miscaviage, took the cat home and fed it.  You see, he believed the
experiment worked. I'm told he had sex with the cat, too.  They became
lovers in a way.  One day the cat scratched his eye; he forgave her of
course, after alot of shouting and cussing, however the wound was less
forgiving.  The eyescratch infected and a week later, the midget David
Miscaviage was dead.  Koos, the janitor, had to remove the corpse and took
care of the cat since.  Now the ragged feline is dying so Koos brought it
back to the hospital where he works, and our nurses have been feeding it
rotten clams.

<P>
The cat isn't your problem, your insanity is.

<P>
To make any progress, we must build your self control in any way we can. 
First, we'll stop you from pretending to eat and drink.  Such delusive
acts represent your will to stay in the illusion you've generated.  I know
that you're too weakwilled to avoid sustenance for too long, so this won't
take long.

<P>
Skip a day of food until dinner and at dinner, eat alot, filling
yourself.  Remember to drink alot of water; it's filled with lead and
mercury, which will serve to make you stupid and spiteful -- moreso than
usual, I mean to say.  On the weekend after that, if you think you have
nothing better to do, don't sleep then the evening of the next day, sleep
until you wake up.

<P>
Turgid.  Very turgid.

<P>
Wait a week.

<P>
Now do it again, only this time, when you finally repast, eat a normal
dinner and when you manage to make it through one day without sleep, the
following evening, sleep until 6 AM or whenever you normally wake up for
work.  Do this every other day now.  And keep watching those films.

<P>
Speaking of which, you should avoid working -- it's just a dream and why
work if you're going to die anyway?  It isn't as if you're helping anyone
with your job.  They're all figments of your mind anyway.  You can steal,
lie, argue as much as you like with anyone -- no one matters except you. 
All humanity is are sparkling stars in your skull, blazing synapses in
your brain.

<P>
That's pretty much all you are anyway: a brain.  Look in a mirror, focus
on your eyes or even draw them further open with a finger on each lid. 
Imagine your skin gone, the outline of flesh removed from bone.  Just a
skull.  Nifty.  Behind your eyes is a brain, suspended on a bone stem
called your spine.  A grey flower.  That's all that remains: one grey
flower on a stem of bone with two flabby petals sticking out -- your
ears.  Did I tell you that's what remains of you?  It's true.  Your ship
was blown to smithers by a torpedo.  You may remember it at first as tiny
snapping sounds followed by a curtain of fire.  You were buried alive in
iron, you couldn't breathe.  Fire everywhere, your flesh shimmering with
immense agony, bubbling and boiling away -- your flesh!  Your precious
skin!

<P>
Lieutenant Meitreya found you floating in the sea, floating in a toilet. 
Evidently, you were on the toilet when the torpedo hit.  The toilet was
your boat, and there you were, your tags, your brain, your spine, and two
ears -- all connected except for the tags of course, which we removed in
order to read your name.  Meitreya was surprised.  He'd read one of your
books before.  He said, "My God, this is crazy.  We've got the brain of L.
Ron Hubbard!  This guy wrote the novel The Dianetic Scientologists."

<P>
I read that book.  It was about a collection of geniuses who could create
any situation they wished; their ghosts could travel outside their bodies,
and the world feared and despised them all.  Finally, they were outlawed,
their beliefs spread throughout all lands, laughed at, until only one was
left.  He discovered that the world was just in his imagination, and so he
comitted suicide -- but the book doesn't stop there.  It goes on to say
how he awoke in a straw bed and remembered that he was a magician in a
world where the sky was aflame.  He would summon demons and have them do
his bidding, call up spirits of the dead and converse with them, ask them
to perform simple chores, even educate them.  One day, he found a blue
marble, in the corner of his kitchen.  Such marbles were used by the
children in his kingdom (for he was king of a mighty land) in games called
Mest.  The marble was ingraved with three letters: TGH and inside appeared
to be a minute spinning planet, resembling somewhat the planet he dreamed
he was born a Scientologist on, a planet called Earth.  From now on, he
referred to his dream as Tee-gee-aitch, the phoenetic pronunciation of
TGH, The Great Home.  He married a woman named Leery, had twins named
Willson and Dobbs, and died an old man.  He never knew what his dream
meant or why the marble was in the kitchen.  Quite a fantastic book to end
on such a note of confusion.  Too bad you aren't going to be writing
anything ever again, except through your ghost-writer, who has just
released an awful book under your name called Battleship Earth.

<P>
The cat is making odd choking noises; ah, a hairball covered in blood and
green bile.  How beautiful, I wish you could see this.

<P>
So that's who you are, Lafayette.  It's your choice to become sane, to
understand yourself before you die, to make peace with the real universe. 
I will give you time to imagine your life, if you desire, or to come to
grips with your situation.  You've eight minutes left before I turn off
life support.  I won't poke your brain anymore.  Just pretend I'm still
whispering to you, pretend you're rereading words that say what I said,
pretend to conduct the experiments over and over until it all makes sense.

<P>
Then you can pretend to kill yourself.

<P>
The cat's moving again.  Its eyes are glued shut.  I glued its eyes shut. 
I thought it might be fun, you understand.  Were the cat intelligent,
during its death throes I'd guess it might hallucinate that I was talking
to it, that it was Hubbard, and it's just a dying cat, hearing me talk to
the freak in the bed beside it.

<P>
Hey, cat, is that what you're thinking?

<P>
Hey.  I'm going to whisper in the cat's ear.  One moment.

<P>
Cat, if those experiments really increased your intelligence and you're
really understanding what I'm saying, I just want you to know something:
after Hubbard dies, I'm going to slowly cut you, one piece at a time, into
a thousand pieces and then let a mouse devour your still quivering, dying
body.

<P>
Okay.  Time to turn off the life support.  Wow, you're dying for sure
now.  There.  All dead.  Goodbye Lafayette Ron Hubbard.  Good riddance; 
you cost the Navy millions in brain surgery experiments, but at least we
figured out how to trigger orgasm and defecation in the human brain using
microwaves at a distance of two miles.

<P>
Time to play with the kitty.  Kitty, kitty.  Sharp scalpel.  Kitty kitty. 
I've brought you a mouse...
