<title>The world's oldest goth speaks . . .</title></head>
<body>
"*hack* *cough* *cough*--damn lungs. You'd think I'd get some interesting 
disease like TB, but I have to be content with wasting from lung cancer. 
That's what I get for chain-smoking cloves--how many? Oh, about 100 packs 
a day *hack* *spit*.<p>
	"Now where was I? Oh, yeah, those goth kids these days. Yelling 
about how much they hate different bands that they can get at any darn 
store they please. Why, when I was your age, we couldn't get any CD we 
wanted. We didn't even had CDs! We had order import 7 inches--and we 
could only get "Bela Lugosi's Dead" or something by those Southern Death 
Cult guys. Yep, we would take our import 7 inches and play them on our 
Vitorolas. Yeah, the ones with the cranks, you little wiseass! We would 
turn the crank a couple of hundred times while praying that we didn't 
scratch our 'Bela' 7 inches. And we liked it! In fact, we loved it!<p>
	"Email? We didn't even have that. We would just send each 
messages by punch cards. If you wanted to get together for dinner, you 
had to send the message a month in advance. And we liked it! In fact, we 
loved it!<p>
	"And we didn't go around saying that we were vampires, no siree. 
We didn't even go out at all a lot of nights! We would just sit in the 
dark, teasing our hair, cranking our Vitorolas. When we did go out, we 
would to 'goth night' at this club on alternate Tuesdays. It had a 
million building violations and the DJ often got the weird-ass idea to 
play George Jones. And why did you think we stayed at home, huh?  Roving 
bands of Klansmen would beat us goths up, after they were done with 
lynching some Black people. You think drunken frat boys are bad? Try 
having a cross burning on your front lawn!<p>
	"Kids today . . ."  <p>
