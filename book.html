<title>Notes at a Buck A Book</title></head>
<body>
I was browsing  through Buck a Book, and came across one  particular  book.  The
cover--a  pensive,  brooding  man with dark hair and kind eyes  hovering  over a
notebook.  He was a character  in <i>One Life to Live</i>, and this is supposed to be
his notebook of thoughts and feelings.  I can relate--I carried several versions
of such a notebook.  In it, some  ghostwriter  details the romance of  "Patrick"
and "Marty", and their painful (for all involved) breakup when she married 
another man.
<p>
Let me start this by saying that I hate soap operas.  I like overwrought
emotions and visual lushness as the next person, but there is something cheap
about all this.  I am broke, bisexual, polyamorous, alternately masculine and
feminine acting, deeply romantic and loyal to more than one lover, and 
confused--where's my place in this amber-lighted universe?
<p>
So it was mainly curiosity that made me pick up this book--and love poetry
from the likes of Yeats, Lord Byron, Shakespeare and others. 
<p>
I got a little shaken by the start.  Why does the  introduction  need to remind
the reader that she (I am using that  pronoun  because  the target  audience  is
hetreosexual  women)  is  reading  about a scene in  Ireland?  "Irish  whiskey,"
"Irish  peat," some old man named Liam--I know that the Irish are supposed to be
maudlin sentimentalists, but even we have our limits. Hell, I slammed down
<i>the Vampire Lestat</i> when I found out that the female drummer of Satan's 
Night Out was named Tough Cookie. One dumbass move, and I'm pissed.
<p>
But still I skimmed it, if only to read the poetry.  I saw  pictures of "Marty,"
"Patrick,"  and  her  soon-to-be  husband  "Dylan."  Something   screamed  "Hey,
"Marty",  why not  both?"  Here are  these  obivous  great  guys,  different  in
temperment and dreams, but similiarly good-hearted.
<p>
But people in the love triangle seemed happy being monogamous, and the viewers 
of the soap opera would perfer them monogamous. What does the opinion of a 
pervert matter?
<p>
Besides, the love poems that "Patrick" quoted concentrated on one person.
About the only other time when they were written about more than one
is when the speaker is a cad stringing along other women. But maybe Paul was 
right about one thing--love is not selfish and greedy. It loves the whole 
person, and realizes that the beloved has thoughts, feelings, and
experiences not like the lover. Maybe "Patrick" needs to pick up some modern
poetry. :)
<p>
But still, real life women will be buying this book. Women who are busy working.
Women with negiglent, abusive, or absent husbands and boyfriends. Women with 
whiny kids. Women who watched every episode of <i>One Life to Live</i> just to see
this triangle.
<p>
The female readers were saying these poems out loud and imagining that "Patrick"
is  reading  them to only them.  It made me pissed for some  reason.  People are
isolated by physical  distance and the emotional  distance helped by television.
To cure this, some turn to  television-generated  fantasies for their  emotional
hunger.  And the cycle goes on.  I am not saying that television is the only
cause--but it helps.
<p>
It made my heart ache for these women--I can't say why. It's more than sympathy.
Parents, books, movies, television make it seem like your life is in preparation
for this one man that will be your everything and will make you whole.
No one can fulfill all your desires, and only you can make yourself whole. How 
could they just give in and believe all this crap?
<p>
I don't pretend to know everything--but I know that there is something wrong
with that picture. It doesn't have to be that way. My lovers and mainly
friends are proof.
<p>
I guess it is my duty as a weirdo to laugh at these  women glued to their TV and
holding  back tears of longing.  But I'm not  stupid.  There but by the grace of
"Bob" goes I.
