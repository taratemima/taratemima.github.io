</P>
        Will I see you again<BR>
now that it is night,<BR>
now that I am alone?<BR>
What will I dream?<BR>
In my bed I feel chilly and sensitive.<BR>
I lie here, try to go asleep, and feel nervous.

<P>
        I'm sorry if I pace from living room to kitchen, nervous.<br>
It's because I want to be calmed with kisses again.<br>
Your grey wool suit makes my hands sensitive,<br>
reminds me of the corpse-like snowy night.<br>
Can I lay in your arms and dream?<BR>
This moment is exceptional, being with you alone.

<P>
        I am not ignoring you; I want to read alone.<br>
While you read, don't be nervous.<BR>
I'll think of your black curls as if I'm remembering a dream.<br>
I'll come back into the living room again,<br>
walk upstairs, go in the room and hold you close at night;<br>
we know that underneath the indifference we have hearts and skin--sensitive

<P>
        Your velvet dress and sapphire bullet eyes confuse the sensitive.<br>
When you leave the hotel, I'll think alone<br>
how cum drips like wax at night<BR>
and how I feel damp and hot and hopeful yet nervous.<br>
I should learn not to see you again,<BR>
but I do, in confused pursuit of a dream.

<P>
        You're under a blanket, pale as the last seconds of a dream.<br>
Under jeans and panties, I am horribly sensitive.<br>
You know that, so you touch again.<BR>
I feel like I slap him hard when I am not with him alone<br>
and your thick fingers make me estastic yet nervous.<br>
I sink ambivalently into pillows and the dark cloudy night.<br>

<P>
        One last semi-sweet memory tonight<br>
Your stick figure constant, yet it fades into dreams.<br>
Your night terrors make me empathically nervous,<br>
likewise, you were to my moods and heartache sensitive.<br>
In times even my personal gods left me alone,<br>
you would wipe my tears and raise my eyes to the moon again.

<P>
        I think of my loves again, memories of sensitive<br>
synapases, incubating fleshy, febrile dreams of them alone.<br>
It all makes me nervous, yet I'll do this again.<br>
