If I can sum up the cartoon, it would be "Jesus is back, and he is pissed at the assholes who used his name to justify sexism, hatred of gays, xenophobia, and bad hair." However, the wrath of the Son of Man and the outbreak of even more religious violence is too much for heaven to ignore. So, now they are moving heaven and hell to stop him. Can they? Should they?
<p>
This is about the 'will of God,' the breaking point of a loving man, and how eager we are to have all the 'bad people' destroyed and not so eager to realize that we are the 'bad people.' It is really at the brainstorming stage, starting with an IM session between John and me. He downloaded an animation program. I sent him my ideas, so we'll see what he does with them.
