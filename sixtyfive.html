Self Portrait at age 65

<P>
I never thought I'd make it this far. I have made ongoing bets that I wouldn't
live up to 18, 21, 25, 30--after 45, I stopped counting.

<P>
Yesterday was M.'s funeral. Once, I thought I would be with him until I was
old and grey. But . . .you know how it is, things get in the way. Right now,
I can't remember the details. 
 She  died long before him. Except for me, his brother, and surviving friends,
he was alone. I remember sometimes falling asleep, my arm under A. and M. 
That's gone now. Anyway, he was 74, it wasn't like it was an untimely death.
Still, I really didn't want to see him preserved like sausage in that coffin.

<P>
I still remember him, laughing at something boneheaded someone said. I still
wish I could hug him, trying to wrap my arms around him and realizing that 
didn't reach. I miss all those long conversations with him. Despite we working
with computers, he was a philosopher at heart and I was an artist. What was 
A.? I never really knew, and I am sorry about that. There was a time I loved 
her; grieved everyday that I lost her. It doesn't hurt as much anymore.

<P>
I have no pictures, most of my friends are tended to by friends and family 
far away or dead. Some of them still dressed like they did when they were 
younger, like the old women in the 90s taking out their short sleeve, knee 
length dresses and dancing to Brenda Lee. Now I hum Sunshine Blind in my old
age. I don't wear black as much anymore--enough time for that when someone 
dies.

<P>
Tom once told me that he never imagined that he'd have any friends in his 
old age, with some dying from AIDS complications or suicide. A couple more 
died of what I could only call bad luck. Yeah, dying young sucks, but who said 
dying itself was a picnic?

<P>
People I dated who are still alive--very few really. I laugh 
sometimes with Paul about how neither of us expect to live this long. I suspect
that if he gets really sick, he'll take his own life. I don't want him to. 
Who will I have to talk to, to kiss, now that M. is gone? I can't count
how many people I knew are dead, either now or earlier. Is this what my 
grandmother felt like? I am seeing new simulcasts and paid rant hours up--
no place for the old anywhere? Isn't that always the way? 

<P>
I make it a point to attend their funerals. I have a social life--I dance and 
play cribbage, buy music and read the news, write and do some contract work. 
All gets dropped for a funeral. I care about them--I want closure.

<P>
I let L. cry on my shoulder when her husband died. I necked with her husband
several times as a younger woman, but she knew. She also knew that it never 
went beyond necking. He died while in New Zealand. 
"He died in a foreign land . . ."--now I have "Goddamn the Sun" in my head.

<P>
I miss being held. I miss the warmth of their kisses. I miss making them laugh.
I miss their voices. I'll never fully see what's in their thoughts, what they
believe in. All around me are their ghosts. "Even now the face of Beatriz is
distorting and fading."

<P>
Mailing list friends are divided. Some died sooner than others. Thank gods,
very few killed themselves. I think sometimes that I never really knew them.
I know what they said in front of me and did in front of me, and wrote,
but their inner selves are dead in the grave with them.

<P>
When I came home, I got a telegram. A memorial service at the temple for V.
I calculate how take on the Greyhound to Philadelphia.

<P>
A funny story--I dressed up as old woman when I was younger and went to Manray.
I put temporary dye in my hair and made wrinkles with make-up. I looked like 
my grandmother. Few people recognized me. Most people were spooked--a memento 
mori that went beyond skulls and graves.

<P>
I put on a sweater and drink my coffee--all I have are ghosts and sentimental 
objects.

<P>
Really, why bother keeping a diary? Simple. I am writing all their stories
(and mine too) so that we don't die too soon.
