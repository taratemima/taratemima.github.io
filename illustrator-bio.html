I am currently a Junior at Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Michigan, studying to be an animator/graphic designer.  I like to draw and work on my 2 websites in my spare time.  My style is heavily influenced on American and Japanese comics, which I like to collect.

I first came up with the idea of the comic from reading one of Tara's fanfics.  I've always liked the idea of two males and a female pairings.  At first I didn't want the comic to have a fantasy/sci fi aspect, but soon I found just having the romance and drama to be boring.  During a discussion with Tara, the ideas of the comic came to me.  I wanted the main character, the girl, to become Death and have supernatural powers.  Then I wanted her two lovers to be her guardians and have some powers as well.  I have always liked stories with the main character having powers, and them having these guardians for protection and love.  It's probably from watching Sailor Moon (LoL).  Usually my comic ideas get as far as to drawing the characters, and then it is scraped.  But when I was talking with Tara, she offered to write it for me.  I am not a good writer, or that I am too lazy to sit down and write out the story (LoL).  So it was a relief to me when she offered.  Both her ideas, and mine  worked well together for this comic.  I am glad to have met her and to be working on this wonderful project.  I hope after this series, that we could possibly make more web comics.
