                      Pooka and the Dolls

<P>
Pooka was three and had animals.  The walls had ghosts, Pooka had animals,
and that makes as much sense as a gun, if you have a gun pointed at you. 
Pooka would point his animals at people.  This did not make much sense for
some reason but Pooka was that sort of guy, the sort that if you argued
age differentials, he'd burble, "I'm dead.  Want food."

<P>
Pooka and a dog.  There was a dog too.  The dog would lick Pooka up and
then let him go.  Pooka would slam the dog with the flat of his hand,
which was okay by the dog, who was large as the world.  The dog would lick
Pooka up and Pooka would slam the dog's nose.  All love and saliva.  Isn't
it more beautiful than a mirror?  No?  Ah, here's the clincher: Pooka and
the dog watched ghosts up the walls.  Here is how.

<P>
Sitting in the middle of the carpet, Pooka and the dog would watch ghosts
on the ceiling til someone on the phone noticed both boy and ancient
mammal were staring raptly at a single point on the ceiling.  The ghost
would opportune then to slide along the ceiling to the corner where it met
two walls, then it would slide to the ground with a muffled noise of
impact, which caused Rusty's ears to perk and Pooka to open his eyes a
little wider.  Both would stare then at the person on the phone who would
begin to whimper and quickly excuse herself to visit the restroom for a
bit.  Quite a pleasing exeunt for a ghost and Pooka pleased ghosts, that's
what he did.

<P>
Pooka was three and had animals, one of which was a blood red rabbit named
Bunny.  Bunny and the other animals had no mouths and some had no eyes
because Pooka noticed they stared with glassen eyes and screamed
frequently.  This was unpleasant for Pooka so he tore off their mouths and
removed a few of their eyes perforce his strong fingers and panic.  These
were proper animals.

<P>
One day, when the dog was sad, Pooka revealed to the dog that we all die,
every one of us, and the dog felt a lot better and began to eat a yellow
furry snake, which was Lady Bathory's favorite, so Pooka had to give the
snake a sock head of the same color as its body.  Sexbat approved of it,
so it was okay.

<P>
Pooka grew up to be quite a looker but was too sad and crazed for anyone
to like much, so he had to slit his wrists one day and no one cared too
much, although they did wonder a bit at why he'd quit posting.
