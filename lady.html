<title>The Great Unrequited Love Affair</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="FFFFFF">
I first saw her in an office, in the midst of clicking keys and TLAs. We
 talked about the Jargon File and she seemed excited that I had the html 
version on my bookmark file. She was small and attractive, with blond hair and
 a cupid mouth. Even though she was in high school, she could talk to me about
 books and music I know about and even tell me about things I didn't know 
about (which can be ego-bruising at times). I liked her, but she was dating 
someone, and I have a policy about such things.<p>
We went down to Tosci's for ice cream. We talked about the joys of hazelnut 
ice cream. I think the conversation went something like this. I mentioned in 
some casual context or another that I was bisexual. "Oh well, I was wondering 
on whether or not to
 make a pass at you." I giggled into my ice cream cone over the relevation.<p>
But still, she was dating some kid. She sent me email telling that she was 
dating the guy out of boredom and that he will be leaving in three weeks. In 
the meantime, she would rather not get into a relationship.<p>
I respected that, so I tried to leave her alone. I wrote her a poem and begged
 her to think nothing of it. I written more about and felt inadequete that my
 inspiration didn't come from anything intirguing to other people like quantum
 physics or Arabic
 matriarchies. I dated someone who broke up with me after four days (and 
spawned a long tortured letting go, but that's another therapy session :)), but 
I still thought of her. I was terrified of what I thinking of. I mean, an old 
trusted friend dated her 
and told me that she "didn't like sex much" and had a mean streak. Eeek, I 
have a temper and am perputually horny; whatever relationship that comes out 
of it is as good as doomed. Of course, he did things like, as she said it, 
"felt [her] up in Downtown Crossing."<p> 
She went on to date some other kid, making me wonder what was wrong with 
me. Everytime I see her, I wonder what I'll say. Once she went off with a 
group of kids, and I restrained the urge to yell "Wait, come back!" I got 
scared when she didn't answer mail or respond to talk for 
I-can't-remember-how-long, prompting her to send 
me mail telling me "just chill. By the way, UMB talk (function) doesn't work."
<p>
Other than desperate email communication, my infatuation manifested in weird 
ways. For example, I don't like Tori Amos all that much. If I wanted mystical 
dreamy vocals, I'd put on Kate Bush. Yet, I am fixated on <i>Little Earthquakes</i>, 
especially the songs "Crucify" and "Girl ("She's been everybody else's girl/
maybe someday/she'll be yours"--oops, wrong lyrics, I'm hearing what I want to
 hear)." As I write this, it seems absurd, but then again, I haven't
listened to it in a while. I also had been looking at 
pictures of skinny wavy-haired blondes with cupid bow lips, blue eyes and 
slender wrists rather intently lately.<p> 
What was a annoying yet enjoyable infatuation is now critical. I am in 
relationship with a very sweet guy who likes me. I should be happy; that girl 
should be at the back of my mind. Then I see her again at Arisia with red hair
 and those *lips* colored black. If this keeps up, he'll feel neglected and 
leave me. There is a possiblity that a real love will be dashed because of 
some castle-in-cloud fantasy. My dear old friend is probably sick of
my obsessing over his ex-girlfriend. *Arrrrrrrghhhhh*<p>
Doubtlessly, I will piss some people off. I will piss off the girl, and the 
fact that this unrequited love is over the World Wide Web. I will piss off the
 guy--why haven't I written anything about him? This is a last resort. Maybe 
I'll find strength enough to love myself in the aftermath.
<p>
Update: I broke up with the guy I was dating when I wrote this (around
March of this year). I am okay, not as tortured about her; I've on to
other futile unrequited romances.
<p>
Update (1999): I've forgotten her, at least I don't wonder what could have been any more. It never was. <p>
The tendency, it's still there.<p>
