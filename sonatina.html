Sontina with Violin and Hand Grenade
<br>by Tara
<p>Danny and Tim in occupied France, and how they fight back. (NC-17)
<p>AU Danny/Tim, placing them and a lot of other people in Occupied France
in
<br>September 1942. Conspiracy, explosions, mention of underaged sex, m/m
sex, and
<br>sarcasm. Any mistakes about Paris and partisan life are mine. No attempt
was
<br>made at depicting safer sex practices (though I know VD was a concern
back then,
<br>just not HIV) or depicting actual lubricants in use during WWII.
<p>This is a work of fiction, historic, mind you, incorporating some biographical
<br>details, but still fiction.&nbsp; I mean, they were born nowhere near
the vicinity of
<br>World War II
<p>I don't know if Messrs Elfman and Burton are or were seeing each other,
I doubt
<br>it, but if they are, mazel tov, guys. I also don't know if they 'employ
girls or
<br>boys,' and I doubt I will get the answer.
<p>My German and French are via Babelfish, feel free to correct it. Anny
Levy
<br>Latour is a real person (though I don't think she told folks where
to find
<br>resistance groups, just fronted them fake ID papers), but the rest
of the folks
<br>aren't.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Don't scream too loud, we don't want anyone to hear us, Daniel."
<p>I wince and hiss at Johann, "Yes, but you're not the one who just got
shot in
<br>the leg by some fucking Vichyssois no-account." And I was just there
to see if I
<br>could pass some working papers as legitimate. Now, someone else will
have to
<br>'test.'
<p>Richard, damn him, just smirks, "Maybe if you don't call him 'a sad,
stupid
<br>bastard,' you won't be in some much pain."
<p>"And you would have resisted the urge to?" Richard turns away. He has
as big a
<br>mouth as I do, he's subtle about his contempt, however. He would have
made a
<br>good lawyer, if the Nazis didn't make the law school Judenrein.
<p>How did I get to this? I was just a rootless youth who wrote songs at
a
<br>cabaret, then Leon Schneiderman got rounded up and so many other threats.
I
<br>didn't do this out of some desire to be a hero (get in trouble, maybe).
<p>I just wanted nothing to happen to my friends and family. Yeah, even
Richard.
<p>And Tim, who just walks in, trying to hide worry in those sleepy eyes.
I don't
<br>think he expected to be part of this either. Timothe&eacute;, fellow
watcher of Murneau
<br>movies, just a young Left Bank kid who thought it would be a great
idea to
<br>design the sets, then we had to run out of a restaurant after a prank
I pulled.
<br>Didn't think I'd fall in love, and not that hard. Now, he is still
gentle and
<br>full of light. I'm getting to be as dark and sharp as Sergeant Ellison.
Or maybe
<br>I would if Tim wasn't here.
<p>Tim walks in and sits beside me. "Do you need company, Daniel?"
<p>I blink. "Yes, if you aren't afraid of blood."
<p>He nods and lays his hand on mine. "I'm only afraid of losing France."
He then
<br>bends down to kiss me. "And you."
<p>I could feel Johann digging in with the forceps, trying to pull the
bullet out.
<br>I shut my eyes, maybe from the pain, maybe just the memory of pain.
I feel
<br>another
<br>pressure, and open to see Tim holding my hand. "Squeeze if you need
to."
<p>So, I do, and wait as I feel less the stinging pain and more hollow,
feel
<br>bandages and salve on the wound.
<p>"Rest," Johann advices before washing his hands again. I relax my hand
in Tim's.
<p>I won't leave, not yet.
<p>A small woman, blonde and pixie-like, runs in the room. "I bring you
gifts." It
<br>was preserved fruit, jams, salted meat, clown paint and firearms.
<p>Rabbi Asimov sits in his study as the sun sets, making him a shadow
against the
<br>vast orange light. His gabbai, Nehemiah, brought in a note.
<p>"Issac,
<br>I have not failed you.
<br>Sincerely,
<br>L. Cohen."
<p><i>I'm in the grammar school, deep in the basement. I haven't eaten
for days, but I</i>
<br><i>forgot to count how long its been. Never mind I could count to one
thousand,</i>
<br><i>making my parents laugh.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I know why I'm here. The teacher mixed up the past and present tense
of penser.</i>
<br><i>I corrected him, and was caned, then tossed in the basement. I'm
down here until</i>
<br><i>I tell the entire class I was wrong. But I wasn't wrong. Mama taught
me French</i>
<br><i>before I came to this school. I want to see Mama again. I want out,
but I don't</i>
<br><i>want to lie and say I was wrong. Papa always told me it was wrong
to lie.</i>
<br><i>It's so dark, and I wonder what will happen. I learned the word
'death' when I</i>
<br><i>saw Richard's bird stiff, not ruffling its feathers, singing its
song. I loved</i>
<br><i>to whistle tunes to the bird, listen to the bird try to imitate
me. Mama told me</i>
<br><i>the bird's soul is in Paradise, Gan Eden</i><i></i>
<p><i>No-one will get me out. I will join that bird. I'm so hungry . .
.</i>
<p>I wake up with the start. Richard would laugh at me if he know about
this dream.
<br>He takes great pleasure in mocking Herr Doktor Freud, that dreams are
somehow
<br>significant, not just odd images that you see in sleep. So, I never
tell Richard
<br>I have been having this nightmare since I was nine.
<p>Oh yes, I survived. Mother and Father pulled me out and demanded to
know what
<br>happened. The thing was, the teacher knew he made a mistake, but me
correcting
<br>him marked me as someone who 'needed his will broken like a stubborn
mule.' The
<br>basement was meant to teach me to 'obey my elders.' Father did not
like his
<br>youngest son being compared to an animal.
<p>I do not want to give the impression my parents did not discipline me
when I did
<br>something wrong, but they often used words instead of their hands.
Somehow, they
<br>thought compassion was a higher ideal than obedience, and wanted me
to know
<br>that. I don't know if they succeeded.
<p>Tim walked by the door. "You're awake?"
<p>"I just woke up. Come in, I will need to call the others too."
<p>He walks in, tangled dark hair, baggy work shirt and dirty denim pants.
"I can
<br>do that."
<p>I shake my head. "Later, I haven't been alone with you since two days
ago."
<p>He gives me a shadow of a grin and kisses me. I squirm when he touches
me, with
<br>pencil-callused fingertips over bare skin. When I reach for him though,
the dull
<br>pain of the wound sears through me.
<p>"Rest," Tim says, as he continues the little caresses on my neck and
wrists.
<br>Easy for him to say, I can only thank whomever runs these things my
erection
<br>didn't make these pants too tight.
<p><i>The H&eacute;loise and Ab&eacute;lard monument: that's where Tim
kissed me. We ran out of the</i>
<br><i>restaurant, after my act as Count Orlok got out of hand, frightening
the</i>
<br><i>patrons. I didn't mean it, I just was demonstrating how many times
I have</i>
<br><i>watched Nosferatu. He was the one who asked to dine with me, since
he pulled me</i>
<br><i>over to show me sketches. So many good ideas for backgrounds, so
shy, so content</i>
<br><i>to listen to me, but when he talked of the days he'd wander through
Paris</i>
<br><i>between classes at ENCAD, sketching, he was quick, fluent, big brown
eyes</i>
<br><i>shining. Wait, am I thinking of him that way? If I wanted that,
there are plenty</i>
<br><i>of alleyways to wander down.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Does he . . . of course not, what about the girl who he kissed goodbye
before</i>
<br><i>walking to the restaurant with me? Lovely little thing too, pale,
silky dark</i>
<br><i>hair, just full-enough lips and just big-enough eyes. Her name was</i>
<br><i>Louise-Marguerite. Lovers, most definitely.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Sorry I did that. I got carried away." I felt embarrassed, which
is good, since</i>
<br><i>that means I am not stupid drunk from the wine.</i>
<p><i>He shook his head. "Don't mind. Good night to walk. But don't want
to go home</i>
<br><i>yet."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"I'm in no mood for cabaret."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"I have another idea."</i><i></i>
<p><i>I have no fear of cemeteries, even Christian ones. So when Tim lead
me to</i>
<br><i>P&egrave;re-Lachaise, I treated it as if we were walking through
the park. He gestured</i>
<br><i>to some point, hands flapping. "Like to sketch here . . .and here,
oh here too."</i>
<br><i>He stabbed his finger at the H&eacute;loise and Ab&eacute;lard.
"I love here especially." So</i>
<br><i>then, we walked. Strange that he briefly touched me on my back .
. .</i>
<br><i>"Know what I like best about here?" Tim whispers in the shadow of
the chapel.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I looked at him, wondering, wondering if this is 'artistic eccentricity.'</i>
<br><i>"What?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>He leans closer, tilting his head down just looking in my eyes, his
face</i>
<br><i>reflecting in my pince-nez. "The history." Then his lips just touch
my forehead.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I must be reading him wrong, or reading him just right, I cannot
tell anymore.</i>
<br><i>"What about the girl?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Louise-Marguerite is my best friend. Grew up together, was my model.
We made a</i>
<br><i>pact once. We cuddle, we talk, but we could take into bed anyone
we wanted.</i>
<br><i>Maybe for the night. Maybe forever. Maybe more than sex. Louise-Marguerite
and I</i>
<br><i>will stay friends."</i>
<p><i>He smelled like coffee and a trace of merlot. "I fell for you when
I first saw</i>
<br><i>you, singing in the cabaret. The way you moved . . .I don't understand
German,</i>
<br><i>but I loved your voice in that one song, what is it, 'Ich Liebe
Madchenen?'"</i><i></i>
<p><i>I snorted. That song got me death threats from people who understand
German.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I looked up at him. "Do you want me for the night or forever?" Maybe
it was</i>
<br><i>unguarded for me, but part of me worried, wondered if I was just
going to be</i>
<br><i>used for his pleasure, like a certain classics professor I knew.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"I want you until you get tired of me." Then he leaned closer, so
close to a</i>
<br><i>kiss.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"You don't want me, if you think that scene at the restaurant was
mad, just</i>
<br><i>watch me when I am angry . . ."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Daniel?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Yes?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>He put his long finger against my lips, leaned down, and kissed me.
So warm, so</i>
<br><i>pure, his fingers tangle in my hair . . .I pulled away.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Do you know how old I am?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>He pursed his lips. "Eighteen? That's not too bad, I am seventeen."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Tim, I'll be twenty-two in a few days."</i>
<p><i>He kissed me again. "Doesn't matter."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"One more question?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Yes?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Could we go to your apartment? My brother's wife is sensitive to
noise and I am</i>
<br><i>not sure the dead would like us fucking near their graves."</i><i></i>
<p><i>He smiled. "That would be rude, wouldn't it." Then we went to his
home.</i>
<p>Tim breaks the reverie by touching my thigh. The pain from the wound
now mingles
<br>with anticipation, confusing the hell out of me. He trails his fingers
along to
<br>my stomach, then lays his hand on just where I want to be touched.
I wanted to
<br>get up, grab him in my arms and kiss him deep while grinding hip against
hip.
<br>But all I could do is wait.
<p>He smiles shy and dark and opens one pants button. He pulls out my work
shirt,
<br>touching my exposed abdomen. I stop trying to figure out pain and longing.
<br>Tim stays calm, looking with dispassionate hooded eyes. He then trails
along
<br>my hip, making me shudder.
<p>Then we hear footsteps. He buttons my pants back, kisses me on the lips
and
<br>whispers "Later."
<p>Never love a simple lad,
<br>Guard against a wise,
<br>Shun a timid youth and sad,
<br>Hide from haunted eyes.
<br>--Dorothy Parker
<p>Out of the ash
<br>I rise with my red hair
<br>And I eat men like air.
<br>- Sylvia Plath
<p><i>So much music, so much color, so much light. Ever since expulsion,
I have been</i>
<br><i>going to the cabaret every night. If I do not feel like music, I
go to the</i>
<br><i>moving pictures theatre. There was also some new innovation in the
moving shadow</i>
<br><i>and light like a painting in motion. I need all the light I can,
I feel like I</i>
<br><i>lost it after expulsion.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I am seventeen, and I fell in love with a man ten years my elder.
Herr Professor</i>
<br><i>Acker, the classics instructor, we would sneak around to kiss, to
touch, for him</i>
<br><i>to play with my hair. Red hair fascinated him, drove him crazy.
"Fairy blood,"</i>
<br><i>he'd murmur just before moving his tongue down my stomach, over
my abdomen,</i>
<br><i>taking me inside his mouth. In Paris, I came to know people who
could not come</i>
<br><i>without a whip, a pair of silk pants, an object. A fetish, Herr
Professor saw me</i>
<br><i>as a fetish. I didn't see it back then, I thought we were entranced
by each</i>
<br><i>other.</i><i></i>
<p><i>When he announced his engagement, I thought little of it at first.
I knew boys</i>
<br><i>who would get a fiancee while still fooling around with certain
people, men or</i>
<br><i>women. Then he told me he couldn't see me anymore. Herr Professor
Acker made a</i>
<br><i>big deal of ethics and the union of a man and a woman being like
Christ and the</i>
<br><i>Church. The fool realizes I don't give a shit about Christ. I was
the fool for</i>
<br><i>thinking we were a union.</i>
<p><i>I take up with Isolde, I start drinking, stopped, but my marks were
falling. Is</i>
<br><i>the Herr Professor connected? I don't know, and somehow, I feel
alone, even with</i>
<br><i>Isolde. What do my parents see of this, a son who could have been
an pianist, a</i>
<br><i>doctor, or orchestra violinist? I wasted my talent, never got the
Abitur I</i>
<br><i>worked so hard for before, while Richard is arriving in law school
early. Hell,</i>
<br><i>if he could, he would be a conductor, perhaps join a moving pictures
studio and</i>
<br><i>learn how to use the camera.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Months later, the Nazis set up so many restrictions, the cabarets
and motion</i>
<br><i>picture theaters are no longer much fun. Isolde's parents forbade
her to be seen</i>
<br><i>around me, just didn't want to invite trouble. Mother and Father
are fired from</i>
<br><i>their jobs and take a friend's invitation to move to Sweden.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Alone, I move to Paris. Three months after I get my work permit,
I am no longer</i>
<br><i>considered a citizen of Germany, along with others people of the
faith of Moses.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Somehow, I am renewed. I play violin in orchestra pits, in the streets,
getting</i>
<br><i>enough for a small room and smaller meals. Sometimes, in the summer,
I get a job</i>
<br><i>as a dishwasher, sweating out poisons and trying to remind myself
I am a goddamn</i>
<br><i>artist and this was no disgrace. Then Richard is kicked out of law
school and</i>
<br><i>comes to live with me. I tired of the selections, tired of working,
was finding</i>
<br><i>myself composing my own music, setting poems I've written as a schoolboy,</i>
<br><i>writing new poems.</i>
<p><i>"So let's start our own cabaret. I set aside money when I clerked
at the law</i>
<br><i>firm. I would love to set up acts, coordinate songs. You could compose,
set up</i>
<br><i>an orchestra, find singers and acts!" I saw a new side of Richard,
one that</i>
<br><i>longed for art, but banked on respect. When he lost respect, for
something that</i>
<br><i>he could not control, he decided art was the way to go.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"But where will we find such a place, Richard?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>In the six arrondissement was an abandoned publishing company. Dark,
quiet, with</i>
<br><i>small hidden rooms. A shipping floor is made into a stage. We make
dressing</i>
<br><i>rooms out of curtains and screens. The secretary's pool is now the
orchestra</i>
<br><i>pit. Now we find a band.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Outside of Paris, the world is ablaze or struggling, and people have
come to</i>
<br><i>find one safe place. Stefan Bartek the Czech as strings, Juan Avila
and Juan</i>
<br><i>Hernandez, otherwise known as Vatos, the Spanish Republicans as
a double bass and</i>
<br><i>drums, and Leon Schneiderman the Pole with the saxophone. Three
Americans came</i>
<br><i>for the horn section, Dexter, Sluggo and his girl Jane, whose name
would always get</i>
<br><i>mispronounced. Michel played piano. Helene was a cellist, Christine
was a fifteen year</i>
<br><i>old farm girl who ran away from home and took up cigarettes, occasional
cross-dressing</i>
<br><i>and poetry, Marie Pascale did trapeze and recitation. Tatiana was
a daughter of Russian</i>
<br><i>refugees who sewed and designed the costumes, while Johann was a
Bohemian in</i>
<br><i>both senses who took up a life of an iteriant doctor after medical
school and a</i>
<br><i>stint in Senegal.</i><i></i>
<p><i>We had a nice group.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Les Clowns de la Mort. Our true name. The partisans will use it, if
they aren't
<br>tight-assed Reds (then we're the Onze Arrondissement Memorial Band),
the Nazis
<br>will not. No special name is needed for partisans.
<p>It turns out that Richard is coming in with today's take, along with
Christine,
<br>Vatos and Johann. The rest are already coordinating their schemes,
and we only
<br>know about them when they're done.
<p>As is custom, they come with their instruments after a day of busking.
Christine
<br>has her guitar, Richard his accordion, Johann his red and blue juggling
balls
<br>and Vatos his top hat (his thing is magic tricks). We could get salaries
from
<br>the High Command, but we leave no paper trail, no detectable connection
to other
<br>partisan units, a convenient way to communicate without being noticed
and we can
<br>track movements of the Nazis and their French counterparts. No one
pays
<br>attention to a busker if they're very good.
<p>Timothe&eacute; hands me some rough crutches and I get up. Vatos speaks
first. "A hotel
<br>in the premier arrondissement is hosting Luftwaffe, setting aside special
<br>amenities for them. We want them to understand that they cannot bow
to those who
<br>want to break France."
<p>"Break France? Are we talking about a country or a woman with bone troubles?"
<br>Richard retorts. The problem is less that they don't agree on how much
they hate
<br>the Nazis, but that Vatos talks like revolutionary and Richard talks
like a
<br>cynic.
<p>"I remember seeing the Nazis cart away paintings, painting I learned
to sketch
<br>from." That was Tim's way of saying he agreed with Vatos.
<p>Christine brushes her dark brown hair out of her face. "Isn't that a
little
<br>foolish? There might be trains to derail, people to hide."
<p>Vatos won't give it up. "The hotel owners are collaborators with fascists,
and
<br>we cannot let them think they will not be hurt by it."
<p>Richard is still not convinced. "Rhetoric's no reason to risk our lives
by going
<br>there."
<p>Vatos has one last card. "Okay, how's this? One of the amenities is
oompa
<br>music."
<p>Richard looks at him in mock horror. "My God, Hernandez, why didn't
you say
<br>something before? Let's torch the place!"
<p>Johann shakes his head. "Not torch, maybe a small bomb, even a grenade."
<p>"So how do you get there," Christine asks.
<p>"I--busboy--in the hotel--some maps . . ." Tim breathes. "I drew some
maps of
<br>the hotel. Metro station. An exit route."
<p>Richard considers. "Much appreciated, Tim," Richard says. He's convinced.
<p>My turn. "Okay, whose going?"
<p>Christine shakes her head. "Not me, I think I got followed the last
time I
<br>delivered a message."
<p>Richard laughs, "Yeah, but they probably are looking for a young man
with big
<br>green eyes and dark hair." She still dresses in male drag for courier
<br>assignments.
<p>"I could go," Vatos suggests.
<p>Johann is not convinced. "I think you're on the wanted list for your
activities
<br>in Spain, not good. I don't think I can go, my French is not so great."
<p>Richard nods. "I got some meeting with a possible new recruit with Dexter.
Wish
<br>me luck."
<p>Tim shrugs. "Not good at speaking."
<p>Normally, I would stay in the background, coordinate and plot. But the
people
<br>mentioning explosives made me impulsive. "I'll go."
<p>Richard looks at me confused. "I know you and your explosives factor
in the old
<br>country house, but you realize how easy it would be to describe you,
should you
<br>get sighted? You're a short redhead with glasses. God help you if they
figure
<br>out you're not 'Aryan.'"
<p>"Blind hallways, found some doors." Thanks for the information, Tim.
<p>"What he said."
<p>"And the leg?," Richard continues.
<p>"He should be careful of sharp corners, but he is fine, in my opinion,"
Johann
<br>says.
<p>Richard sighs. "It's your funeral, little brother."
<p>I shrug. "Like opposing the occupiers aren't ours?"
<p>Dinner came and went, some folks left for the night, I stay at the abandoned
<br>cottage until morning. I'm alone and waiting for sleep.
<p>I hear the creak of the door and see Tim walking in. Thank God I saw
him before
<br>I could reach for my pistol. Hell, despite preferring bare feet, I
wear unlaced
<br>boots in case I have to get out.
<p>He smirks lopsided and comes to the side of the bed. "Does it still
hurt," he
<br>whispers.
<p>I nod. "Not as badly as it did."
<p>"Oh," and those damn fingers are on my cheek. I haven't shaven in a
while, and I
<br>am sure that my hair is close to my collar. He just strokes the side
of my face,
<br>not minding.
<p>He leans down to kiss me, and slides his fingers down to the side of
my neck.
<br>The longing from earlier came back, and so did the frustration.
<p>He stops stroking my neck and starts unbuttoning my shirt. I stop him.
"I can do
<br>it myself. I want to see you take your own clothes off."
<p>He shakes his head. "Or I can take yours off while you take mine." That
just
<br>might be a good idea. So he started popping off my shirt buttons and
I tried to
<br>beat his record from where I was lying.
<p>Tim then slides under my blanket, taking care to kneel over the uninjured
leg.
<br>He lies down kissing me while I rest my hands on his back and pull
him in. We
<br>have this ritual of rubbing body parts affected by daily busking. I
work on his
<br>wrists and fingers, since sometimes they can get tense from holding
a pencil.
<br>After that, he massages the right side of my cheek, my chin, my shoulders
and my
<br>arms, places most affected by violin playing.
<p>Nights that I have free and I am going out for a mission are hard. I
want the
<br>both of us to forget our troubles for an hour or more, drown in mad
passion, but
<br>worry it will be too fast, too mild. If this was the last night with
Tim I am
<br>ever going to have, what should I make this night the best goddamn
night I can?
<br>Or maybe I am thinking too hard? Isn't the small pleasures best done
without
<br>expectation? Damn, I ought to stop thinking.
<p>We straddle each other's leg, rubbing against each other. The kissing
becomes
<br>more frantic, and I stopped caring that someone will hear. At this
point,
<br>though, any murmurs and groans are stifled by our mouths.
<p>I pull away, and start unbuttoning my pants. Tim is startled at first,
then
<br>seeing what I was doing, followed in kind. "I kinda wanted to build
up to that
<br>point earlier, but then . . ."
<p>"I know," I reply, "I guess I am feeling a little agitated tonight."
<p>Tim grabs at my boxers, making me twitch. "A little?," he smirks.
<p>"No, that's from earlier."
<p>He smirks even more. "I seem to have that effect on you the first time
we met."
<p>"I seem to have an effect on you too. You would still be in school."
<p>He shifts his eyes down. "Actually, you were the reason I wore the yellow
badge.
<br>Remember? You and your brother wouldn't go anywhere because of it."
<p>"Almost forgot about it."
<p>He nods, and speaks like a child telling about a fight in school. "I
was angry
<br>that you wouldn't go to the moving picture theatre with me, I swiped
an old
<br>classmate's badge and wore it when I took the bus home. After getting
yelled for
<br>breaking curfew by some gendarmes, they looked at my papers and figured
out I
<br>wasn't Jewish. That threw them off, which was the idea." He pauses.
"They never
<br>did return that Poe book they confiscated."
<p>That I didn't know, and now my lust is somewhat interrupted, and feeling
ready
<br>to begin again. I have one more question, though. "So, why did you
drop out of
<br>school?"
<p>"Oh, I was a few months away from graduation, but apparently there were
some
<br>changes to the schooling. I was given a lecture from the student advisor
not to
<br>sketch in P&egrave;re Lachaise and from 'degenerate artists.' Focus
on bringing joy
<br>through art. Emphasis on form, beauty, and the life-force. In short,
sketch
<br>muscle-bound blonds and don't admit that everything changes and dies."
He sticks
<br>his tongue out in disgust. "I am not even interested in blonds. Okay,
Helene is
<br>pretty, but that's not the point. I came to school to learn how to
draw what I
<br>want, not take orders on what to draw."
<p>Oh I understand, so it wasn't love that drove Tim from school, it was
someone
<br>trying to dictate to him what his creations should be like. Sounds
familiar.
<p>He shakes his head, pillow-flattened curls flying. "Who gives a fuck
right now?
<br>It's done. If the stupid bastards ever leave, I would go back."
<p>"Um. Yes, there are a lot of things I would do after this is over, but
I want to
<br>do one thing right now."
<p>"Me too." He finishes unbuttoning his pants and underwear and hops out
of the
<br>bed, sliding them off. I take advantage of the space to take mine off.
After a
<br>few seconds, I decide to just kick off the boots. I'll take my chances
with the
<br>cold ground; never liked shoes anyway.
<p>We hop quickly back in, the autumn air making us chilly. After minutes
of
<br>rubbing against each other and kissing, we warm up. Then Tim sits up
and leans
<br>over me and I heat up. He thrusts his hips against my stomach, making
sure
<br>that the head of his dick is just between the cleft of stomach muscle.
I myself
<br>am finding out I can rub against his solid left inner thigh.
<p>Then he stops and slides down, his chin stopping at my chest. "Radiant,"
he says
<br>smiling.
<p>"What? Me?"
<p>"The moon . . .on your skin, makes you look like a sculpture. Like a
<br>masterpiece."
<p>Flatterer. I don't mind. The moon is doing interesting things to him
too, making
<br>his skin more intensely milk-pale, the shadows on his face making him
both like
<br>an angel and an imp. What if someone sees us? I can always reach for
my pistol
<br>if someone tries to stop our fun. Killing while fucking. I almost like
the idea.
<br>Just what the hell is wrong with me?
<p>He slides down further, underneath the blanket, then straddling. I almost
want
<br>to continue fondling and rubbing. I forget that when I feel warm lips
and tongue
<br>on the head, the shaft, then the whole thing. Didn't think he'd try
that. He
<br>starts to hum, and I really didn't expect that. Especially not the
humming of
<br>"Minnie the Moocher." Ha ha, Timothe&eacute;, but I'm too busy gasping.
<p>He lets go with a wet sound and leans down to the edge of the bed. My
eyebrows
<br>go up; what am I getting from you? He pulls out a long bottle filled
with some
<br>amber-colored liquid. Somehow, my mind is enough in the gutter to put
it
<br>together.
<p>"Tim, if you wanted that, we could always use se--"
<p>"No, want to come while you're inside me."
<p>"There's a petrol shortage, you know."
<p>"Not that." He hands me the bottle and won't tell me anymore.
<br>I sigh and sit up, with Tim kneeling still. I pour a drop on my fingers:
<br>slippery and vaguely spicy-scented, not making me itch or burn. Okay,
I guess
<br>somehow Leonard's gang got some weird connections and somehow Timothe&eacute;
found
<br>out. Just when I think he's this little innocent lost soul, he surprises
me.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I poured some on my hands, coating my dick enough, watching it mix
with saliva
<br>and precum. I pull Tim close to me, trying to keep a steady grip. My
coated
<br>fingers slip around the crevice, then around the opening, then inside
stroking
<br>the prostate. Tim still kneels, whimpering, looking impatient, like
a hungry man
<br>in a rations line.
<p>With my hands guiding him and his own blind instinct, he perches on
my lap,
<br>taking me inside him. When he finally lands, I think I lose all thought.
<br>Now it is a matter of Timothe&eacute; rocking on his hands and pulling
me further
<br>inside the encompassing heat, and me trying to hold out longer than
he does. I
<br>cheat a little; I wrap my arms around him until we are close together,
skin on
<br>skin.
<p>I guess he decides to cheat too, touching the wound through the bandage.
I
<br>twitch in surprise, jerking from the mix of pain and arousal. In a
sort of
<br>vengeance, I wrap my hand around his dick. He pleads with desperate,
dilated
<br>eyes, "Not yet, please."
<p>"I don't want to stop right now either." So I let go and place my hands
back on
<br>his back. I then slow the thrusts, squeezing my eyes shut to keep myself
steady.
<p>Tim kisses me again, pressing his dick more against my stomach. Just
hold on,
<br>hold on . . .don't want to get too close to coming, even my nerves
ring out and
<br>I get harder.
<p>My hands slide from his back to his hip, which had the nice effect of
making him
<br>squirm. Then the squirming becomes gasping and jerking hips. He shivers
when he
<br>comes, like he's in midst of a fever dream. The moment he bares his
neck, I
<br>pounce, biting as he finishes the last of his orgasm.
<p>It takes longer for me to come, but not much longer. I could taste his
sweat as
<br>I groan into his skin, as I constrict and pour and burn . . .
<p>It is over. I am an empty jug. All I can do is let go of his neck and
lean
<br>against his chest. Soon I will have to let go of him and fall back
down into the
<br>bed. Not yet.
<p>"Mein K&ouml;nigreich und Ort von Verlust, sehen Sie nie das Wasser
zu flie&szlig;en."
<p>Where did I hear that line before? Once when I was in Berlin . . .
<p>I wake up and find myself cleaned of last night, but still naked under
the
<br>blanket. Tim is gone, but I still have to get dressed, get on the road,
then on
<br>the Metro. Grenades are hidden in the tote bag, and I shall look as
<br>inconspicuous as possible.
<p>I wear a clean shirt, clean underwear, the same pants as I wore yesterday,
a
<br>frayed gray coat and a riding cap, tucking in my hair. Yes, I haven't
been
<br>identified yet, but I feel my hair is a big curly red sign say "Arrest
me!"
<br>Funny I pay more attention to my appearance than my speech.
<p><i>If Tim wasn't making set backdrops, I wasn't writing music and we
weren't having</i>
<br><i>argumentative discussions on what backdrop went when, we were necking
and more</i>
<br><i>in his apartment or in my apartment when my sister-in-law was taking
baby Louis</i>
<br><i>on walks. It was a good year, despite war and little work, we had
acts, we had</i>
<br><i>accolades, we even occasionally used the money for something other
than the</i>
<br><i>cabaret.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I dislike summer (pale skin and longer days means sunburn) but the
summer of</i>
<br><i>1940 was the worst. I stayed in the house when the Nazis marched
in Paris,</i>
<br><i>drinking water and wondering if I should run or hide.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Then I heard the bad news: one of the conditions of the armistice
is the</i>
<br><i>internment of German Jews and dissenters who fled to France. I don't
think being</i>
<br><i>naturalized would protect Johann, Richard and me from deportation.
Marie might</i>
<br><i>be affected. Heinrich Ellison's last letter warned of deportations
and work</i>
<br><i>camps. He suspects something worst, but isn't sure. Fuck.</i>
<p><i>So, Richard and I talked about it, argued about it. Everyone had
reason to fear</i>
<br><i>the new order, and God help us if we took them all down with us.
The plan was to</i>
<br><i>sell the cabaret and use the money for passage to England. Meanwhile,
I would go</i>
<br><i>back to dishwashing, Richard would box again (that hobby of his
during</i>
<br><i>university just might save us) and Marie would clean houses (only
work</i>
<br><i>available). Johann can baby-sit Louis during days. After announcing
the</i>
<br><i>dissolving of Les Clowns de la Mort, the rest wander away to school,
to</i>
<br><i>construction jobs, to busking, to a circus and to bread lines.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Will I see you again," Tim asked me at the last meeting.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"I don't know." I thought I never would.</i><i></i>
<p><i>After that, I got into the routine of working from dawn to dusk,
sweating water</i>
<br><i>out and reminding myself this was no disgrace and no one has asked
for my papers</i>
<br><i>before. After, I would spend time at Tulli&egrave;res, watching
but not wanting the</i>
<br><i>attractive people milling around, then lock myself in my room and
finish the</i>
<br><i>compositions I kept putting off. I didn't sleep much. I didn't want
to lie there</i>
<br><i>and be afraid of being taken away in the middle of the night.</i>
<p><i>Self-sufficiency. Emotional distance. I tried to do that when I first
moved,</i>
<br><i>still sore from rejection. Women thought they would be the ones
to heal my</i>
<br><i>wounded heart; men thought I would be a guilt-free distraction.
Former was</i>
<br><i>wrong, and somehow, I no longer want to be that for the later.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Then Leon, looking for work, signed up with some newly created government</i>
<br><i>organization called UJIF. I wasn't sure about this. I never really
got a chance</i>
<br><i>to find out what came after losing citizenship in Germany. I don't
know if I</i>
<br><i>wanted to know.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I find out from Marie Leon never came to visit her. Coming to the
border of his</i>
<br><i>neighborhood, he saw the ring of gendarmes and found out Leon and
his sister</i>
<br><i>Gittel was arrested and deported for being foreign-born.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Who do the Schneidermans have to spy for, the rabbits in the field?
Leon and</i>
<br><i>Gittel made the decision to live and work in France. There is nothing
for them</i>
<br><i>in Poland. They're not even Communists."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"The gendarme told me he was following orders."</i>
<p><i>Fans saved my life. Two lyc&eacute;e girls, regular matinee attendees
at</i>
<br><i>the cabaret, worried about my safety. Through a series of violet-scented
notes</i>
<br><i>and hastily arranged meetings, I came to know Anny Latour, born
Austrian, a</i>
<br><i>naturalized Frenchwoman, a Jewish woman in hiding. She offered me
a choice:</i>
<br><i>false work papers for France, or false passport and papers for England.</i>
<br><i>Then my big mouth got the best of me. "I don't want to leave here,
I loved it</i>
<br><i>here, I loved it as it was, with all the players and my friends,
even when I had</i>
<br><i>no money, the customers sucked and no one liked the music. I want
to stay but I</i>
<br><i>am surrounded by oblivious kiss-asses who have every reason to denounce
me and</i>
<br><i>the people I care about. I left Germany because of this shit." I
stared down at</i>
<br><i>my cup of tea. "I don't want to take anyone down with me. One of
them is gone</i>
<br><i>already, at Drancy, I am told. I want to fight this fucking regime
but I don't</i>
<br><i>know how. I'm no solider, I'm just a funny man who can write music.
Now I have</i>
<br><i>no voice."</i><i></i>
<p><i>Anny looked at me. "You are not the only one who feels this way,
Daniel. There</i>
<br><i>are many people, French and immigrant, Christian and Jewish, who
are sickened by</i>
<br><i>Petain's surrender. You know it is dangerous to stay here, but you
may find a</i>
<br><i>way to get your voice back. I can only make it less likely you will
be</i>
<br><i>deported."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Where do I find these people?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>"You might be surprised."</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I zig down streets, zag into alley ways, and find the hotel just as
Tim drew it.
<p>There is a service entrance around here, according to this other map.
I look at
<br>myself, deciding I look more like a dishwasher than a guest. Fine,
my cover
<br>story, business is still brisk thanks to their Nazi-catering. One more
<br>dishwasher will not be noticed.
<p><i>On a rare free night, I went to a lecture at L'Muse&eacute; de l'Homme.
Indonesian</i>
<br><i>instruments, demonstrating and comparing. In between, there were
subtle digs at</i>
<br><i>the racial theories of the Nazis (and the French government fucks
helping them).</i><i></i>
<p><i>Nervous, I decide I wanted to talk to the lecturer, find out if there
is work I</i>
<br><i>can do to refute said theories. I was walking up the hallway to
the lecturer</i>
<br><i>when I saw a familiar figure sitting in a bench. Thin, in black,
holding a</i>
<br><i>sketch pad . . .</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Tim?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>He bolted up and looked at me. "I wanted to find you, but I wasn't
sure if they</i>
<br><i>took you away or you ran off to another country and I didn't want
to tip off</i>
<br><i>anyone so I would go to cafes when I had a free period and wait
for you where</i>
<br><i>were . . ."</i><i></i>
<p><i>All I wanted to do, all I did was to scoop him in my arms and hold
him. He</i>
<br><i>whispered in my ear, "Don't scare me like that again."</i>
<p>I grab a laundry cart, stuff my jacket in there and just walk down the
hallway.
<br>The hat stays on, though. I wind down the hallway with the cart, when
I hear it.
<p>The thud of drum and tuba. Yes, oompa. How to get the grenade in there
and not
<br>get noticed?
<p><i>I had a whole speech planned for Richard, Johann and Marie: I know
someone who</i>
<br><i>can get them passage to England, who gave me reliable working papers,
but I am</i>
<br><i>staying in Paris, working in some way toward liberation. Okay, I'm
writing</i>
<br><i>poetry for an underground newspaper and leaving mimeographed sarcasm
in Metro</i>
<br><i>stations, but it is a start. I might get deported, maybe die in
prison, but at</i>
<br><i>least I will be with people I have come to know and care about in
this city.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Then, in the small kitchen late at night, Richard spoke. "I am staying
here.</i>
<br><i>Marie has roots here, Johann has taken the whores of Paris under
his wing again,</i>
<br><i>and even with boxing, I don't think I have enough to get to England
or Canada."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Richard, I know someone who can give you working papers. I also
want to show</i>
<br><i>you some stuff I wrote."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"You're not leaving?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>"No."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"We actually agree on something."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Should we put up a brass plaque?"</i>
<p>"Feign great indifference but maintain secret anger. It will serve you
well."
<br>--from "Advice to the Occupied," an essay written by Jean Texcier and
secretly
<br>circulated through France
<p>"What is to be done? Be present everywhere. Stand up."
<br>--from Que faire?, a tract written by David Knout and circulated to
the Jewish
<br>communities in France
<p>The door was just where Tim drew it. From what I gathered, it lead to
the
<br>balcony, then back stage. The trick is to throw the grenade in an empty
room,
<br>and get away fast from both the blast and the chaos.
<p>I turn it experimentally. Unlocked. I walk in, looking like just another
hotel
<br>employee.
<p><i>"So what can we do?" I asked that question to Richard, Marie, Johann,
Tim and</i>
<br><i>Louise, as we sat around the table, drinking stolen seltzer water
with black</i>
<br><i>market peppermint syrup. Louis was on Marie's lap, looking out at
all of us.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"I mean," I continued, "we're not soldiers. None of us have ever
fought in a</i>
<br><i>war."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"I almost enlisted when the Hitlerites invaded," Richard added, "but
that year</i>
<br><i>in the German army was grounds for refusal. I don't understand.
I just cleared</i>
<br><i>brush and swept floors before my final year."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Look at it this way, I would be trying to release you from POW camps
if you</i>
<br><i>did," Marie said in a practical frame of mind.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"We're not ideologues. We only paid some attention to elections,
except when</i>
<br><i>there was something absurd going on," Tim added.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I shrugged. "I became a little obsessed with politics after leaving
Germany. I</i>
<br><i>guess I didn't want to be caught up in fleeing a country I thouht
I was part of</i>
<br><i>again."</i><i></i>
<p><i>Richard nodded. "A lot of that happening. These days, the news just
makes me so</i>
<br><i>angry."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"English lessons, again," Marie smiled. That's their little term
for Richard</i>
<br><i>listening to the BBC.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Richard shook his head. "French lessons. Or rather, lessons in propaganda.
Poor,</i>
<br><i>put-upon Hitler, coming in to save us all from French decadence,
from jabbering</i>
<br><i>politicians, from the dark plots of Jews and Freemasons . . ."</i>
<p><i>"I'm destroying civilization. Hurrah."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"You always take all the credit, Daniel."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"It must be the Freemasons only, because if you ran France, we'd
have a bigger</i>
<br><i>apartment," Marie said.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Yes, yes, the point is that if you just go by what the radio is
telling you,</i>
<br><i>the Germans were sent by God Himself to restore order and discipline
and that</i>
<br><i>sound you hear is not Napoleon spinning in his grave," Richard continues.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Listen to the quavering voice of Petain and all will be well," Marie
said.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Johann had a thought. "Well look at us, we are not soldiers or politicians,
but</i>
<br><i>at least some of us have lived in Germany. We have seen the street
fights, the</i>
<br><i>fracas between the parties, the no direction. We seen at least some
of what the</i>
<br><i>Nazis intend: disfranchisement of the Jews, banning of 'degenerate
art,' all</i>
<br><i>sorts of things that the newly occupied should be worried about.
I have some</i>
<br><i>experience with their 'racial theories.' I have read their scientific
opponents.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I treated Senegalese, French, Jewish, Arab and German patients. I
can tell you,</i>
<br><i>they are all part of the human race, they all bleed red. "</i><i></i>
<p><i>Marie added, "I hear gossip, rumors. Most are saying the party line,
but sooner</i>
<br><i>or later, there will shortages, and it will be the doing of Nazis
and the</i>
<br><i>Germans who help them."</i><i></i>
<p><i>Tim looked a little nervous. "I can draw. I write poems, sometimes.
I want to</i>
<br><i>help. I'm no Chauvinist, you'll never see me waving the tricolour,
but I want to</i>
<br><i>protect jazz singers, dadaists, people who print Poe." He fell back
in his chair</i>
<br><i>and smiled.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"I know some law, I can listen to English radio and translate. It
will keep my</i>
<br><i>nose from getting broken again." Richard was indoors not just for
that, but</i>
<br><i>because some boxing matches were being watched by the Germans.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Louise was the last to speak. "I know girls from drama classes who
can help. I</i>
<br><i>can deliver. I can recite."</i><i></i>
<p><i>Richard looks at me, "And what about you?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>Now, I wrote some of the more political skits for Le Clowns de la
Mort. At some</i>
<br><i>point, I made fun of Fascists, Communists and Germany. Mama told
me that the</i>
<br><i>Bolsheviks killed or expelled the French teachers from other countries
during</i>
<br><i>the Revolution, so I never really liked Communists, but I hated
the Nazis even</i>
<br><i>more.</i>
<br><i>Sometimes the crowd loved it. Sometimes, some Red screams swears
at me when I</i>
<br><i>dress</i>
<br><i>up as Trotsky, and some people didn't appreciate me mocking the
purge of the</i>
<br><i>Communists while Germany was invading Poland and the Netherlands.</i>
<br><i>Now, songs would probably be too obvious. I have got poems, Richard
gave his</i>
<br><i>opinions,</i>
<br><i>but it isn't enough.</i><i></i>
<p><i>I did have a suggestion, though. "I still have letters from Heinrich."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"That old bastard is still alive? I'd think with him working for
that socialist</i>
<br><i>newspaper, he'd be deported," Richard said.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"He sent me his last letter a few days before, literally. He has
gone into</i>
<br><i>hiding, since they are stepping up their round-ups of leftists."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"How did an old Army general become involved with leftists?"</i><i></i>
<p><i>"They were willing to print him."</i><i></i>
<p><i>Richard looked at the rest of the group, who were looking confused.
"Sorry, a</i>
<br><i>word about Heinrich Ellison. See, when we were staying at the cottage
for the</i>
<br><i>summer, Daniel discovered firecrackers." I think I blushed at this
point.</i>
<br><i>"Well, Heinrich caught him, then made a deal with Mother and Father.
He would</i>
<br><i>supervise Daniel with the firecrackers. Over time, they started
on explosives.</i>
<br><i>When he got put in another school, you know, one with competent
French teachers</i>
<br><i>and no dark basements, they started writing."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"About right. After I left for Paris, he wrote about changes in the
government</i>
<br><i>and the edicts against different people. Over time, we had to contact
a black</i>
<br><i>marketeer to deliver the letters. A lot of it was him commenting
on the</i>
<br><i>declaration of war and the fighting with France, detailing that
they had enough</i>
<br><i>material, but not enough faith in the Third Republic. I could translate
it and</i>
<br><i>print them."</i><i></i>
<p><i>Richard nodded. "I'd like to look at them, but good idea."</i><i></i>
<p><i>With that settled, I concluded, "So, counter-propaganda. Well then,
we have a</i>
<br><i>typewriter from my place, you think someone will loan us a mimeograph
machine?"</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>There were indeed several technically empty rooms, filled with furniture
and
<br>dust. I dawdle, mentally calculating if there will be enough noise
and little
<br>damaged.
<p><i>A plan of action fell into place quicker than we expected. L'Muse&eacute;&nbsp;
de l'Homme</i>
<br><i>had a mimeograph machine, and we went with Louise as our liaison.
The finished</i>
<br><i>product got slipped into park benches, subway cars, books for sale,
and other</i>
<br><i>places. With what was left of our old wardrobe, we would scrawl
graffiti around</i>
<br><i>public posters.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Then old friends started to trickle in. Richard was asked by Helene
to do</i>
<br><i>'interpreting work.' Turned out Helene, Christine and Tatiana were
running a</i>
<br><i>safe-house and an escaped English POW needed a guide. Marie met
up with Avila</i>
<br><i>and Vatos before curfew and gave them an alibi after they cut some
telephone</i>
<br><i>cables. Tim and Louise met Bartek and Michel on the Metro, all of
them going to</i>
<br><i>the war memorials on Armistice Day, in defiance of a ban of such
things. After</i>
<br><i>they were all released from jail before Christmas, they wrote up
their accounts.</i>
<br><i>Finally, Jane, Sluggo and Dexter met up with Richard to smuggle
foreign</i>
<br><i>newspapers. Les Clowns de la Mort were back, but for a different
purpose.</i><i></i>
<p><i>Our first big prank was printing De Gaulle's infamous June speech
and putting it</i>
<br><i>in three-fourths of a sales flyer. Then came Johann and Richard,
with Christine</i>
<br><i>dressed a schoolboy tagging along, ordering the rest of a Gestapo
birthday</i>
<br><i>banquet to be transported to different neighborhoods. If it weren't
for the</i>
<br><i>costumes, they would have been so arrested.</i><i></i>
<p><i>It all went bloody fast, with us transmitting information by song
sheets,</i>
<br><i>starting to track movements by busking, getting a new mimeograph
machine after</i>
<br><i>the people at L'Muse&eacute;&nbsp; de l'Homme were betrayed and
arrested, hiding prisoners,</i>
<br><i>French Jewish facing round-ups, listening to word of the United
States entering</i>
<br><i>war, working with different Resistance groups (even the Communists).
We gained</i>
<br><i>members, lost members, survived reprisals and watched innocent people
being held</i>
<br><i>hostage and shot because some people didn't want to live in a conquered
country.</i>
<p><i>And now here we are, with guns we haven't learned to use, wondering
when to</i>
<br><i>fight.</i>
<p>One room is large and unfurnished, with just a closet. Wonderful. I
go in and
<br>squinted around. Then, over the oompa music, I could hear footsteps.
I slide
<br>against the wall, hoping the shadows will hide me.
<p>Then the muttering and footsteps come closer. Thinking ahead, I slide
into the
<br>closet and close the door. The footsteps and mutters go away, and it
is all
<br>quiet. So, I turn the doorknob. It is stuck.
<p>That is when I start shaking.
<p>Take deep breaths, Daniel, you are twenty-six, not nine. Think. What
can you do
<br>to get out? The room is empty, anyone that could arrest you can't hear
you over
<br>the oompa music. Look around.
<p>It is so dark. So narrow . . .
<p>Come on, relax. You took in your duffel bag. Of course. I feel my way
in the
<br>darkness, grabbing the handles of the bag. I unzip and grope around
the assorted
<br>items.
<p>A paper bag with bread and dried fruit. I won't go hungry, good. A dull
knife
<br>for the bread. The grenades. A torch? Oh, supplies from the British,
of course.
<br>I grab the torch and flick the switch.
<p>Still works. I can see the torch shake in my hand still.
<p>I shove the dried apricots and raisins into my mouth, then gnaw on the
bread.
<br>There, no longer hungry. I set down the torch and grab the butter knife.
It is
<br>flat and sturdy enough to press the door latch down, letting me out.
My hands
<br>still shake, though.
<p>All the thoughts that terrify me come back. The school basement; the
beatings by
<br>older boys; the hearing where I was officially expelled for academic
decline; my
<br>questioning before the High Command.
<p>"If Timothe&eacute; was caught betraying the group, would you kill him?"
<p>My answer was, "He'd not only betray me but the other people he loves.
So yes, I
<br>would."
<p>So easy to say. I wonder sometimes if I could really do it. Have we
been
<br>together four years? How is it I am still so charmed and soothed by
him,
<br>sometimes even surprised? What would make him break it apart? What
about me?
<p>There are three other couples in our little group. Does Richard, taller
than me,
<br>but still just as red-haired, wonder about slender and dark Marie-Pascale?
Does
<br>Jane, curvy and small with dark brown curls, wonder about tall, broad-shouldered
<br>Sluggo? Johann just got together with Helene. What about them?
<p>Am I the only one who doesn't trust the one I love?
<p>All right, all right, Daniel, calm down. Carrying the torch in the left
and the
<br>butter knife in the right, I scuttle to the door. The shakes continue.
Think
<br>good thoughts. Soothing thoughts.
<p><i>Tim and I took the Metro from the graveyard to some station in six</i>
<br><i>arrondissement. In the small, dark apartment he shared with Louise,
their</i>
<br><i>'bedrooms' were two small beds divided by a curtain.</i><i></i>
<p><i>At the doorway, I kissed him, first soft, then hard, trying to kiss
the air out.</i>
<br><i>I had the idea of leading us to his bed. I thought about touching
and tasting</i>
<br><i>him and being touched and tasted, all nice and slow. Then I felt
him push me</i>
<br><i>against the door frame, managing somehow not to bruise me.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Hey, that was a little fast."</i><i></i>
<p><i>"Yeah. I want you. A lot." His hips pressed against me. He turned
from gentle to</i>
<br><i>forceful.</i><i></i>
<p><i>"You didn't seem to be very strong."</i><i></i>
<p><i>His hands slided down to mine, his fingers on my wrists. "I lift
canvas that are</i>
<br><i>half my weight. I'm not completely helpless."</i><i></i>
<p><i>He kissed me on the nose. "I won't hurt you. No."</i>
<p>That wasn't soothing at all. It did, however, stop the shaking. I slide
the
<br>butter knife between the door and the frame. Patience and effort rewards
me with
<br>a click and an open door. I stand up, grab the bag and walk out the
closet, then
<br>out the room.
<p>I had just one more task. Oompa music still going, I back against the
hallway.
<br>From there, it was a matter of pulling the pin, throwing it quick and
running
<br>the hell away.
<p>After going through blind hallways just like Tim drew, I was out in
the sunlit
<br>world. All around, gray people milled around, German soldiers window-shop
and
<br>the country keeps sliding into collaboration like a hot bath filled
with razors.
<p>Sooner or later, they've got to wake up.
