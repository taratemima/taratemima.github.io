<h4>Magenta and Yellow</h4><p>
There he was, coming on from Park Street. Bright magenta shirt and 
yellow pants, carrying a book called "Gigolo." I could have giggled. Did 
he think he was one?<p> 
But really, how could I care? Things were depressing me, or at least people 
were. 
I have a crush on five people, three I saw that night. 
One I visited in the MITSFS room. I hugged him and scratched his head. 
I couldn't find the words to tell him how bad I feel when he is not around or 
that he is not dating me anymore, how I
don't know what's up. The second I saw at Preacherfest, in arm-length gloves 
and a black dress with spaghetti straps. She hasn't been at SIPB for a week. I 
couldn't tell her that she is the only reason why I'm not studying the 
inessential stuff at
home--that and $US0.45 cans of soda. She left with some kids--I couldn't tell 
her how I wish she was with me. The third was drunk. He kissed me, I wondered 
if he would have kissed me if he was sober. I was in the gloomiest mood 
possible.<p>
Meanwhile, magenta and yellow guy took off his brown shoes to reveal 
green-and-red socks. He laughed loudly sometimes. I pretended not to notice 
what he was doing.<p>
Time passed and I got on my stuff. He apparently noticed me. He also noticed 
my notebook. "What are you writing, bad poetry?" he said in a 
even voice. Is that supposed to be a pick-up line? I wanted to say "What are 
drinking, cheap liquor?" But I figured that it would be best to leave him 
alone.<p> 
When no (verbal) response came, he proclaimed 
"You seem deeply neurotic." Why, thank you, Herr Doktor Freud! *You* 
certainly feel mentally troubled if you have been the recipent of flirts, 
then treated just as a friend, or even ignored. I would say that doubt and
confusion
*would* be troubling. Then again, why should a man who is drunk, has 
sensationalist tastes in literature, and has no concept of proportion in 
colors tell me about *my* mental state?<p>
I, again, said nothing, and got off the train. He got off there too, and got 
on a bus. As I saw the bus pass by, I stuck out my tongue. But he didn't 
notice.<p>
