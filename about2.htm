<div class="MsoNormal">Autobiography</div>

<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was born November 26, 1976 at 10am EST, in Boston,
the oldest of three children, to a young family, pretty unusual in the
70s. My name came out of a dream my mother had, and for the longest time,
I was the only Tara around, it was easy enough to remember, but not too
many people had it when I was a child. I didn't meet another Tara until
I was 14.
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">Childhood? I spent lots of time reading and making
up games with dolls, bouncing from Special Needs to regular classes for
reading, and Gifted and Talented program. I was often told to stop talking
to myself, and sometimes liked walking around, spinning myself. I didn't
know what words like 'autism' and 'attention deficit disorder' meant--I
did know that I wasn't like every other kid. I was good at writing, at
least the teachers liked what I did. I didn't have people who stuck around
me like the other kids. I knew I did not talk in full sentences until age
5. I knew Mom was on something called 'welfare,' which meant she didn't
have much money for anything other than bills, though she tried to get
me toys and books. I had vague memories of my father, doing stuff like
yelling at me for spilling cranberry juice and taking me into a bar, buying
me soft drink after soft drink. Weekdays I went to school, with no teachers
being all good or all bad, Saturdays I watched cartoons, and Sundays I
went to Saint Boniface for Mass. Big days for me as a kid were Halloween,
my birthday, and Christmas, and I watched monster movies when I could.
I was short and slightly chubby, but I biked and walked. I didn't clean
up my room until we moved from my first home, because all the old toys
piled up and I and my mom felt overwhelmed by it all. I went to different
summer camps often emphasising sports, because my mom was concerned about
my physical awkwardness. I hated most of the activities, except arts and
crafts and swimming. I drew on shopping bags and wrote little stories about
what I drew. I never figured there was really a problem. My parents divorced
when I was five, and my mother went on welfare. She took classes, got her
associates, but never finished her bacholars, because she was worried about
her children, she says.
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">I can remember feeling bad about my life at age 10.
It was my first time in full normal classes, aand I was not only overwhelmed
by my assignments, but no one liked me. No one would talk to me, and would
make fun of me when I did. Once, I was at the playground, everyone else
in games and I wasn't invited. I ate chocolate chocolate chip cookies and
wondered if I should kill myself.
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">I hated middle school. I hated being pushed, having
soda and burrs thrown at me, having my books stolen, and being teased for
having big breasts, for praying over my meal (I think in reaction to the
loneliness, I turned to religion, to the Rosary, to old books of Marian
mediations).
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">So, I wanted to go to someplace safe for high school.
My aunts went to one all-girls high school, and they seemed to like it.
So, I got high test scores and got in. I was quiet, had some people to
chat with, and wasn't bothered. If they talked about me behind my back,
it wasn't my concern, I wasn't interested in impressing them.
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was generally a good kid, doing my school work,
avoiding dating, working part-time to afford my tuition, writing for the
school literary magazine. If I did rebel, it was by reading books about
other religions and speculating about the Catholic Church. I also wondered
why I no longer felt any connection to the ritual of Mass, just these motions
I could no longer be in awe of. Is it possible that what I believed about
God and Jesus was not true? Did they even exist? If not, what is there
to do? My stepfather was also getting more violent, more insulting. I wasn't
sure whether I deserved this, whether I could get out of here. College
was my dreamed-of way out of the frequent jail sentences, screaming, unemployment,
and petty crime. I was also in love for the first time, with a lot of lust
too. But he was 23, homeless, and told me repeatly he was unsure of being
with someone so young, shy, and innocent. Unintentionally, I read it as
I could never be loved, never was good enough. My free time was spent listening
to the radio, making mix tapes, and sighing over this person. I graduated,
got accepted to Boston University and UMass Boston. It was cheaper to go
to UMass.
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first month was the hardest, because of school
work and my stepfather's increasing screaming. One night, I heard my brother
screaming and the sound of my stepfather's cane bashing him. He was arrested
(after he broke in the house several times). Life went on much more calmly,
even when he sent misspelt pleas of forgiveness to my mother. I was starting
to have an actual social life, thanks to the local science fiction society
and some people I met role-playing. Then I got on a local goth mailing
list to get in touch with a friend, and found out the people are okay and
the music is much like what I've been listening to. I got on a social mailing
list and meet a lot more people, some even out of state. I dated a couple
of times, had small flings (some went badly), and had crushes on a lot
more.
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">Life went on, and I got tired of the small computer
resources and crumbling infrastructure, so I transferred to Northeastern
University to major in linguistics with a computer science minor. While
places like Boston University have more grounding in the social sciences
and more focus on establishing an academic career, Northeastern's co-op
system showed me places I could work with my major, even if most of my
jobs had to do with my minor. It was a lot of hard work--juggling part
time jobs, not always doing well in computer programming classes, the brief
period I lived away from home that got me in a lot of debt, not really
having the whole 'party from Thursday night to Monday morning' schedule
that is supposedly part of the college experience. Very few of my friends
are from Northeastern, and most are in the linguistics program.
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">I will be graduating soon, and I am very glad I got
what I came for, and still undecided if I want to put the hard work required
for a job in my major. I am continuing work on a novel I started two years
ago, and come a little closer to finishing it. I know I want to write,
I hope to support myself someday through my writing, but that is unlikely.
I am just content with finding a job that pays the bills and using free
time to write, go to concerts, sing, listen to music, and just wander and
ponder.
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">College was also a period where I did more than just
read about different religions, but did stuff involving them. While calling
myself an agnostic, I went to a couple of pagan events, went to skeptics
meetings, and going to Seders held by friends and acquaintances. Somehow,
I wanted something to believe in, something that could explain what I am
doing here, how to put feelings of sadness and worthlessness in perspective,
and how to use a certain talent in writing. Is there a god, is it singular,
many in one, or more than one? How can believers' behavior contradict what
their religion teaches, or use it as a way to act worse?
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">An odd thing was observed: I was often in the Judaica
section, often browsing the different books, and finding myself agreeing
with them. I am not sure how, but I started to get my inner sense of the
divine back--but I still don't know its nature. I am considering conversion,
but here is the catch: I don't want children. I have Asperger's syndrome,
and I really cannot see how I can emotionally support my child, and have
the patience and discernment to teach the child how to be a civilized,
caring person. I think that giving birth will result in more land cut up,
more animals being displaced and dead (and not able to fulfill their own
commandments of being fruitful and multiplying!), and having most of my
dreams and goals subordinated to child rearing. If you read different Jewish-oriented
newspapers and journals, a lot of the discussion is not enough children,
numbers of Jewish people decreasing. It just says 'breed for the cause'
to me and I am not going to be a bad parent for any cause, even if "there's
some many dumb people having children, we need more smart people having
them." Uh, I remember in my biology classes that some traits do not pass
from the parent to the child.
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>


<p class="MsoNormal">But hey, how about the B'nei Noach? Yeah, except 1)
I don't like their politics, 2) they don't seem to think that any same-sex
love relationship is moral. I contain some are (ones not involving casual
sex for instance).
<div class="MsoNormal"></div>

<p>But I assume I will have the answers someday, just not now. My wants
are simple: an way of life that makes me more loving, caring, and thoughtful
and the work of my hands be good for others.
