Where There Is Life<BR>
by Tara Edwards

<P>
Halloween needs to be celebrated, IMHO, and there were three ways 
of doing: going to a party (or concert), trick-or-treating, or going to a 
Samhain service. I don't consider myself a pagan, I cannot blindly believe 
in a Goddess anymore than I can blindly believe in a God, but the idea of 
saying goodbye and celebrating the spiritual pull that autumn and the dead 
have attracts me.
<P>
This Halloween, I couldn't go to a concert I was planning to go 
to due to time and budget constraints. I am too old for trick-or-treating 
("Hello little . . .girl?"), so I went to a Samhain service at MIT. Last 
year, when I went, I was locked out with 3 other people. I arrived 10 
minutes before to make sure I did not repeat that mistake. I saw Alice, 
an old friend, and her lover Jeremy. I saw Amy, Tom, Johanna, Eric, and 
Jason, who were leading the ceremony. I saw a girl from my mailing list 
named Kara. More people trickled in ("I see that people are coming on 
Pagan Standard Time"). Finally, 20 minutes later, the chapel door closed 
and the people quieted down and got into a circle.
<P>
After the invocation to the elements, people chanted. I sang 
along, the tune being vaguely familiar. Then, people representing the 
Green Man (Jason, someone I know) and the Crone (Elizabeth, a woman who I 
only knew from email) danced. They danced and leaped and spun and turned; I 
envied 
their grace. They seemed to have jacked into the spiritual undercurrent 
of all the rituals and prayers. After a while, I didn't think of them as 
Jason and Elizabeth _at all_. The Green Man started to stumble, then 
fall. The Crone put a white cloth across his shoulders; Life is dead. 
<p>

Leaves fall, fruit rot, people turn on you, turn icy, the world becomes 
white and cold, like a corpse, with the bare trees its bones. Words came 
into my head: Kali Jurga, we 
are all hunched like people in winter, concerned only with ourselves. 
A 
woman in a black cloak, turning away from the world, haunts my imaginings 
before I came. 
No, this is not a result of listening to too much Bauhaus. She's a 
rasul--we are guilty of abandoning her. Now the chance is past.<p>
<HR>
<P>
        "Behold," Amy said holding a pomergrate, "the fruit of life." The 
pomergrate was cleanly sliced with a long knife. "Which is the fruit of 
death." I 
knew of the legend of Persephone, who ate 6 pomergrate seeds, and had to 
stay in the underworld, the realm of her kidnapper (let's not gloss 
this), for 6 months. The woman in the cloak--Demeter? Grief, rage, that's 
what she felt. Grief? It was new to me. I was familiar with sadness, but 
not for a person. I never cried at my grandfather's funeral. I didn't 
feel much when I heard that my biological father died of liver damage. I 
cried when I heard that my stepfather killed himself, but only because I 
wished I could have killed him first. But why am I so sad all the time?
<P>
A girl, I had forgotten her name, came up and went to a man. 
The man then got up, knelt, and put his hand on the Green Man's shoulder. 
A woman got up, and put her hand on the Green Man's other 
shoulder. A man got up, and put his hand on the first man's shoulder. I 
began to see that they were making a boat, with hands and shoulders.
<P>
The girl came to me finally. "What do you fear," she whispered. 
"Rejection," I answered after a little thought. "Remember that along the 
path of life, we encounter rejection, and from there, we learn lessons 
and find peace." It was a standard part of the liturgy as far as I can 
tell, but it still comforted me. There is more than turning away and 
turning back. I joined the boat, putting my hand on a guy's shoulder.
<P>
We chanted as more people came. My thoughts occupied with 
mediations on death, remembering the words of the chant, and trying to 
keep my leg from falling asleep. I think I switched positions five 
times. The Green Man then got up, and started to walk.  We went 
downstairs. Intellectually, I knew it was a basement used for "the 
Summerland," but emotionally, I feel like I was going to the eternal 
night.
<P>
I sat down, smelling myrrh and other spices (at least I think 
so). So much went through my mind. I tried my hand at so many 
things--stories, jobs, other projects. They never worked out. And people 
who have died, I realized I missed chances with.  
I didn't know what to 
do, how to patch things up. All I could do was cry. What will I do now? 
A woman I didn't know held my hand. Tom, someone I knew sometimes gave 
me a hug. At least whatever happens, I am not alone.
<P>
We then left the basement and went back to the chapel. Candles 
were the only light and the smell of myrrh was heavy. It was just like--I 
may as well say it--being dead. Being in mourning.
<P>
As I sat on the cold grey floor, I thought of so much. I never 
knew my father--I never knew of anything about him expect Phil Ochs 
songbooks. I never got a chance to learn Gaelic from my grandfather. 
Wayne--I could never reach him, but miss the times when before he got 
arrested, when I could trust and really love him. 
<P>
I thought of all the projects that never got down, the dreams and 
ideals that seem to fade away. I never written a novel--all there is 
scrap. I never learned Russian or Arabic. I haven't learned C 
completely. These are my still-born children, and they were as real as 
anything. All I could do about these losses is cry.     
<P>
I felt my hand squeezed, and someone touched my shoulder. I 
cannot say exactly how it made me feel at the time--I was not alone in 
this, others are grieving for what they loved too.
<P>
We went back, after what seemed like years, to the chapel. "Behold the 
fruit of death," Amy said, holding the apple, " which is the fruit of 
life." Maybe this grief isn't all there is. Maybe I can still do things. 
Maybe I can still tell the people I care about how I feel before its too 
late. It's still not over. "You get what anyone gets. You get a 
lifetime." 
<P>
That stayed with me, even after the final spiral dance of the 
evening. Even in my anger, there might be a way out. 
<P>
I can't say that all is perfect after that. I still have snags to 
deal with. I think I can deal however--and maybe do better than deal. 
Rotting fruit becomes compost, snow waters the flowers, and sometimes, 
people take a look around and try to help. There is still hope. It seems 
the simplest thing to say, but it takes a lot of courage and trust to say it.
