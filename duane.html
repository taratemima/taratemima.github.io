<title>All About Duane</title></head>
<body>
{This essay was adapted from an email message to someone}
<br>
It all started with "Institutionalized." A friend of mine was talking about 
how shocked he was to hear on a local "alternative" radio station. I remembered another time I heard "Institutionalized," on a now defunct show on that station. There was other st
uff played on that show--rap, some obscure band named Hill of Beans playing "Satan, Lend Me a Dollar." The friend remembered how cool he thought the station was when I was visiting Boston. He is living in Massachusetts now, and its changed.<p>
*Sigh*, yes Derek, it was cool, once. Maybe it just seemed that way because Iwas fourteen when I first heard it (after lurking through the morrass of 
AOR and disco). Maybe it was because I first heard it at the few 
precious moments before "alternative" became a synomym for "cock rock all over
again."<p>
I told him about Duane Bruce. I think he was one of the main reasons it was 
cool during that time. He was the DJ there, playing various rare 
and wonderful stuff at his late night show "Radio Free Boston," then 
again on "Moods for Moderns."<p> 
The problems with management began when he had a 9pm-1am slot. There have been arguments over what he can or cannot play, just when Nirvana was becoming big. Duane talked about how mad he was to have to fight to play a certain band and find out that they 
have been playing on an AOR station. The proverbial last straw came when instead of the song he had cued, he accidently played 
"Youth Against Fascism," a song by Sonic Youth (it had the word "fuck"--
oh Gawd!). He was let go.<p>
Of course, this is biased towards Duane (I am sure that the station 
manager at the time, Max Tolkoff, has a different take). Sometimes I didn't like what he was playing, and there are still good people there. We are dealing 
with the FCC and playlists (I learned that quickly when I tried to request Public Enemy's "Assault Vechicle Mix" during his 9pm slot) , after all. 
But must it all be so constricting?<p>
	I am too busy to listen to the radio (much to my dismay). I 
listen to 'FNX only when I am bored and no other stations are playing 
good music. I don't like what I hear. Duane was, last time I heard, at 
Salem State, DJing. I had his telephone number once, but lost it. 
I wonder if he has an email address.<p>
	Goddamn, I miss him. I feel so sad and nostalgic.<p>
