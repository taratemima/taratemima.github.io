   <title>I am so not like Hope Sandoval&lt;/head></title>

<body>
From a message I posted to Elbows:
<p>&nbsp;While I was on the train, two punkish girls came up to me and
asked me "'Scuse me, but are you the girl from Mazzy Star?" I told them
"no," but I wonder what their reaction would be if I said 'yes'? Autographs?
Offerings of their bodies (I wish)?
<p>&nbsp;It was just weird. Where they got the idea that the Hope Sandoval
wore glasses and rode the T, I'll never know.

<p>&nbsp;It reminded me of a story of a poster to the netgoth list. He
was annoyed with "he touched me!" effusiveness that someone on the list
expressed for some member of a local gothic rock band. He responded by
telling of an obnoxious member of a well-known local (Boston) band and
his coterie of pubescent girls. In response, I joked "Well, he's cut out
for a job with Marilyn Manson!" I told him a story about a girl who got
herpes from the "dreadlocked bass player" of MM.
<p>&nbsp;He emailed me back, and said, to paraphrase him, "That's exactly
what I'm trying to tell her! Some people use their fame to get people to
do what they want, and it's not always good for the fan."
<p>&nbsp;I suddenly was glad I told the truth and didn't fall into the
exploiting trap, even for a second.
