<h4>The Birch Circle War</h4><br>
A heart-warming tale of a boy, a girl, an old war hero, and a war that's brewing just outside where they live, and a minute from now. 
<P>

<h5>Synopsis</h5>
<P>
Jacob Bridges, an ordinary geek of all trades and aspiring musician, lives on a small street in an equally small town of Leith, Massachusetts, in the somewhat ordinary year 1982. A fairly colorful cast of characters advise, befriend, and bother the teenager, and fuel the subplots. 
<p>
He falls in love with a girl visiting from Montana named Meg. In time, though, little things and events that do not add up surround her. Her great-aunt, Senga, the street's 'weird old lady,' isn't telling either. And his old friend, Batsheva Rosenthal, is acting a little jealous.
<p>
His next door neighbor and nemesis, Rabbi Craig Rosenthal, has some troubles of his own. His wife, Veronica, is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and he is finding his own ways to deal. Let's not go into the odd events involving a suit of armor . . .
<p>
How Jacob finds out Meg's secret, and how Craig gets pulled into the fight for his--and his neighbors'--lives, is explained in the first series on the tales of the residents of Birch Circle, their pasts, presents, and futures, and their fortunes with the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, in the Birch Circle War.
<p>

<h5>Goals</h5><P>
I am hoping to find an illustrator for this, put some of the series on long, sell merchandise, and then get enough of a following and budget to make dead tree copies. Or maybe just get rejected a couple of times by publishing companies to see what they want.
