More screaming & yelling<p>
Last updated 9/29/98<p>
<i>If Jesus is the answer, then what was the question?"--Jeffrey Jay Lowder</i><p> 
"Talk into the hand!"--whenever Pastor Corbain gets in a person's face 
screaming random Bible cut-up, some would put up their palm, instructing 
Corbain to "talk to the hand." Some give helpful hints on giving up caffeine 
and taking up breath fresheners and Prozac. <p>

Can I get a witness?--Once, a guy yelled "I don't know what that guy is saying,
 but I thank the Lord that I'm saved. I was on drugs, I 
was a wreak, then I accepted Jesus as my Lord and I was saved." You can be 
serious or sarcastic ("God cured a big mole on my ass").One thing I saw was 
dueling and defending preachers. A guy in a cheap maroon suit said such thing 
as "It doesn't have to proven, it just has to be believed," and a Christian 
yuppie. Just to prove not all Christians think alike, a kid with a ponytail 
kept calling Pastor Corbin "preacher of the law" and "Pharisee." An old 
guy once took out a pocket Bible and argued with Corbin. But let's not
 forget the "Sign Guy" (who just doesn't have the lungs for preaching), a 
Jehovah's Witness, a fundie-turned-agnostic, and a red-headed tract hander who
argued furiously with Case<p>

You shall take no other gods than me--Many have done just that. Some have 
invoked Eris, "Bob", gods of Asgard, the Teletubbies and  
 Howard Stern. Pagans have sang hymns in praise of the Goddess (inculding an alternate version of "Amazing Grace"). And 
then there was this guy who dry humped a dog and yelled "Satan! Fuck me like 
the whore I am!" People have also attempted to make converts to the Church of 
the Happy Fuzzy Bunny (people have prostated themselves to him), the Church of the Great Pumpkin, and the Church of Wyatt ("all problems can be solved
by oral sex").  People also have gotten involved in devil-worship--okay worship of a balloon vendor dressed as the devil. 
<p>
Hit me!--I'd like to go on record and say I don't endorse physical violence. It doesn't mean others haven't tried it.
 People have tried to knock his glasses and hat. Some have yelled "Mosh 
pit!!!" One guy even <i>kissed</i> him. It can be funny--I don't endorse it--
really! Once, however, a fight broke out between two people--not fun. Another 
thing I wouldn't endorse is tearing up a Bible and eating (which was 
what some kids did). Put it to good use--quote contradicting verses at him. Another thing--if you have certain views on diet, beating people up will only make your case faulty. Just ask people who have to deal with some violent vegans.   
<p>
Songfest--"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," "Henry the Eighth," 
"Liar," "Heresy ("God is dead/and no one cares . . .")", "Yodelling Satan"
 and other such songs 
provide entertainment for all. There were some kids who tried to sing cheery 
songs about Jesus, but a little loudly sung Trent Reznor usually scares them 
off.
<p>
Talk back!--Some take different words as cues. The most popular is jumping
up and down whenever Corbin does, and yelling along with his catchphrase
"Open up your Bibles you heathens!" (some have replied "Heathens don't have
Bibles!")
When he says "sodomy," 
some hooted and cheer. When he says "fornication," people pretended 
they're having sex (like a young woman who laid on the street as her boyfriend
 pretended to have sex with her) or simply hoot and holler. And of 
course, "What about masturbation" is a popular question. Once, when he 
started using 'r' words (redemption, repentence, reconcillation, etc), we 
added a few of our own--'redundant,' 'repetitive,' and 'retard.' When he 
says "truth," Case yells "You want the truth? You can't handle the truth!" Neef also had said "You want vermouth? You can't handle vermouth!" 
When he says "law," Case yells "I am the law! I am Judge Dredd!" When the 
Pastor says "salvation," Case yells "Resistance is futile, salvation is 
irrevelent, you WILL become one with the Borg!" When the Pastor looks like he's
pooped, people yell "Your powers are weak, old man." When Pastor says "Listen 
friends," I yell "You're not my friend! I have real friends!," "Stop calling me Fred!" "What friends?" or "You 
*have* no friends!" Of 
course, there's Case's act of going around Pastor Corbin with a toy 
tricorder and screaming "Jim! Jim! He has no brain!" There is also the act
 of twisting his words--"What? Lazarus was a ZOMBIE!" Lately people have
also been quoting David Tibet and "South Park" ("Don't say 'pigfucker in
front of Jesus!") Some guy also has yelled at Corbin "How could you call
me friend after what we shared together! Gary, I'm having your baby!" Not like Gary hasn't gotten any good quotations. At one point he yelled "Get your ears out of your wax!"<p>
"The most recent preacher was a pretty good one.  Corbin made that "Get
your ears out of your wax" blunder yet again, about the fifth time in my
memory, and Warren came back with, "Have you got the nose out of your
boogers?  Have you got the ass out of your shit?"  There were also at
least two random men in brassieres, what's the chance of that in any
 week."
<p>
--Paul the Photographer
<p>
Signs--Jeff Chase sometimes puts up signs like "Atheists Do It With 
Style," "It All Started When Janet Reno Burned Down His Church," "Heathens Have More Fun," "Orgasms = 
Exist -- God = Doesn't," "Jesus of the Borg: Resistance Is Futile--You 
Will Be Asslimiated!," "Fire Is Cool Yeah Heh Heh You're All Going Into 
the Fire, Yeah Heh Heh Heh Heh" and "Pastor Corbin Is Feeling a Little 
Agitated Today." Other exchanges have revealed him to be a big old 
hypocrite:<p>
CORBIN: If thou want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, give the money
to the poor, and follow me. <p>
ME: Have you? Have you sold all you own and given the money to the poor?<p>
CORBIN: [dead silence]
<p>
I did get a smile from him when I asked him if he was going to the Fetus Barbaque held by the <a href="http://www.paranoia.com/~coe">Church of Euthensia</a>.
<p>
Personae Dramatis--One guy, Garry, after being pissed that the Pastor was so 
persumptous to define <i>his</i> religion (Judaism) and say that he is going 
to hell (he's gay), that he took the persona of a Nazi jerk that yells that 
people should listen to the Pastor because "he's white, he's male, he's 
Protestant." His act came to an end when some kids followed him, thinking that
 he really was a Nazi. He is then tried to get the Pastor to marry him and his
 SO. A gender 
fucker in a purple dress, grey hat, and a "Jesus" name tag also made an 
apperance. Other pretenders to the Jesus throne have come around, including one offering $5 a fuck. And then there was these two guys and two girls making out  in 
front of 
Corbin, as well as a girl flashing her breasts. Oh yeah, he really got through to them. There was also some guy going 
around talking about someone wearing a cape being "a member of the coven" and 
ranting about the apocolypse and the Marines. Some 
"Rocky rats (fans of late-night "Rocky Horror Picture Show" showings)" in drag
 yelled stuff at him, as did kids in black and Subgenii. Of course, Corbain can yell so loud that people get killed every night.<p>
Free Debate--There are also those who wonder where the Pastor gets off. 
One guy argued that how could he say what the Bible is about since he 
doesn't know the orginial languages of the Bible. Some have wondered why 
people are so "mean" or "close-minded" when dealing with the Pastor. 
A normal-looking woman 
kept asking the Pastor if she can give her fiance a blowjob. <p>
Weather is (Almost) Irrelevent to the Pastor--Snow, rain, and cold 
(and some conferenece in Tennessee) kept Pastor away for a while. But he was
back in 0 or so degree weather screaming his lungs out and jumping and
squating. That lead to this exchange.<p>
Pastor: Do you want to go to hell?<p>
Chuck: Sure, it's warm, and has cool people there.<p>
It Just Gets Weirder All the Time--As if the Pastor was not entertainment 
enough, the Harvard wrestling time went through its initation. We were 
greeted by the site of men in leotards singing "Over the Rainbow" and dancing 
bad ballet. We saw men carrying signs that said "Practice Safe Sex Or Die" and
 "I'm Lebanese And I Love It." (instructs young boys to say "Hey hey/ho 
ho/Western imperialism/has got to go.") We saw Marty Hannigan's roomate and 
MIT alumnus Mike chant "Harvard eats its young!" Some also held a whipping line after Corbin left. Sign Guy dressed up as the Michelin Angel and to quote him, "I've recorded all the stupid things you said." Kinda like the log here.<p>
Flawless Victory!--A man in a wheelchair found one way to get the Pastor 
running--scream real loud. For while, it looked like the Pastor was leaving, 
but he stays in the end. He always does. Never mind that he almost got arrested for distrubing the peace (must be a rookie). He just got on his knees, asking god to help him finish preaching. One wonders if Jesus is saying "Leave me alone, Gary."<p>
Damn sodomites!--Of course, some women go up to the Pastor's daughters and say
 "Why don't we go out for coffee after this and talk about <i>godly</i> things?" 
Of course, the Pastor gets <i>real</i> uncomfortable at any mention at same 
sex fooling around, screaming some nonsense about 'sodomites' when the subject
 comes up. But it isn't all fun and games. When Pastor Corbin gave the
usual 'AIDS is
Gawd's punishment against the ho-mo-sex-you-alls' spiel, someone yelled at
him that her best friend, a devout Christian, died of AIDS.
  <p>
Other people <a href="wyatt.html">contribute their memories</a><P>
This is not a complete list. As soon as more fun stuff come up, I'll put it 
here. In fact, come to Preacherfest and do something funny and noteworthy and 
you will get on here.<P>
