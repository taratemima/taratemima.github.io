<P>Parameters</P>

<P>Parameter theory evolved out of Universal Grammar, in an attempt to articulate &igrave;how children could acquire such rule systems and how they would evaluate them in comparison to descriptively equally adequate ones (Meisel, 11).&icirc; More specifically, drawing from X-bar theory, evaluating how the internal structure would form around the X-bar sentence structure cross-linguistically. No matter how different the surface sentence, it depends on the setting of a single parameter.</P>

<P>How parameters surface in language development, especially child language, is a matter of controversy. Do child language rules draw from the same basic rule types as adults, as Pinker suggests? While an intriguing direction, Meisel warns that it could lead to not having &igrave;principled reasons for deciding which value represents the default setting (16),&icirc; an option for uniform examination of parameters.  </P>

<P>Is the parameter set on a default value, or are both values accessed simultaneously for a limited time in the grammar? With one option activated, either both or all values are accessible, or only the chosen value is available. </P>

<P>Theorists working in parameter theory make a distinction between learning and triggering. &igrave;Learning requires more frequent exposure to the output . . .over a longer period of time, and it probably needs salient and unambiguous input data (Meisel, 14),&icirc; with variation coming out of trial and error. &igrave;Triggering differs from learning in each of these points (Meisel, 14),&icirc; being faster, requiring less frequent and more complex data, and varying little among individuals. Not much was discussed about variation among languages, whether it is the accumulation of learning of longer periods of time, or more involved triggers among language speakers.</P>

<P>The idea of triggering has some issues to examine. One, if the leading assumption that much of the relevant linguistic information is not from the language data, what is the role of input in triggering? Considering how ungrammatical or complex some utterances around the child are, how do triggers generalize from surface properties to the correct setting? Valian proposes the continuous process of a child &euml;floating an utterance&iacute; to generalize about possible corrections. Considering that some child speakers stubbornly hold to certain errors, perhaps it is not a one-time event. On the other hand, Roeper and Weissenborn assume that &igrave;parameter setting is triggered only by a narrowly defined properties of the data, not by all features (Meisel, 19).&icirc; These two theories make two different empirical predictions: one for variation among individuals, and one for similar paths of grammatical development. It is not certain whether it will hold true for across languages, as well. </P>

<P>What of frequency and length of exposure? How much linguistic input does the child need to fix at a certain level? While some have proposed that occasional exposures to different language users would not count toward the total amount of positive evidence needed for theoretical parameter setting, it may very well be possible, albeit a small effect.</P>
<P>From there, theoreticians working with parameter theory ask, how does child language come into adult language? Is there a set, specified maturational schedule, perhaps consistent with sensory-motor development, or later, during puberty? One major feature necessary is that grammar development is predicted to be consistent with Universal Grammar at each stage.</P>

<P>On the ONE hand, internal organization of grammatical principles could contribute to the change. Perhaps both could account for a uniform sequential pattern. On the other hand, do they hold true for every population? What of dyslexics, adults with semantic-pragmatic disorder (a language-related disorder on the autistic spectrum)? Is the pattern true for most spoken (and signed) language? An intriguing question for researchers specializing in neuroscience is Greenfield&iacute;s findings that &igrave;[s]pecific circuits connecting various cortical areas developed as . . .&iacute;multiple short-range connections are pruned to fewer, more specific and longer-range connections (Meisel, 26),&icirc; and if they are fully connected to language. A different version of that hypothesis, the &igrave;Structure Building Hypothesis,&icirc; that state early grammars contain projections of verbs and nouns specifically, with functional categories coming in later in development. </P>

<P> With the different retuning and restating of what parameters are, researchers still have questions. Have more studies addressing setting parameter values been done? If deductive learning eliminates the possibility of triggers just being learning, what is the internal &euml;logic&iacute; of ordering principles? Can parameters be explicitly tested? Have things changed since Meisel summarized the state of parameter research? Also, what subjects could be best be used for knowing at least some parameters?</P>

<P>Perhaps the way to resolve this is to first look at current literary on the parameter theory, and second, start a few studies on small, diverse populations, some child speakers, some bilingual, some adult, perhaps some diagnosed with language disorders. I am very interested in seeing how they clear up discussion on functional heads and issue of &euml;resetting.&iacute;</P>

<P>Parsing in Different Languages</P>

<P>Cuetos, Mitchell, and Corley surveyed three different theories of sentence parsing, looking at them across languages. They are the garden-path theory, with its more involved derivation, construal theory, parameter theory, and tuning theory. The authors conclude that tuning theory best fits and explains the results of testing an ambiguous sentence in Spanish and English. How they come to that conclusion, however, is interesting in itself.</P>

<P>They showed different speakers, from early bilinguals to monolingual English and Spanish speakers, a similar sentence, varying it in different aspects, such as verb agreement and gender. They divided possible answers into high-attachment (the first potential head) and low-attachment (the second potential head).</P>

<P>In English, the sentence was</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Somebody shot the servant of the actress who was on the balcony. </P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In Spanish, the sentence was</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Alguien dispar&Ucirc; contra el criado de la actriz que estaba en el balc&Ucirc;n.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>English readers chose the high-attachment resolution (answering &euml;the actress&iacute; when asked &igrave;Who was on the balcony?&icirc;), while Spanish speakers chose the low-attachment resolution. When subject-verb agreement and gender agreement lead them to different answers, while they chose the &euml;right&iacute; answer, reading times for these sentences took longer than ones leading to their preferred resolution. While studying Spanish-English bilinguals, they seem to switch between high-attachment for English, and low attachment for Spanish. </P>

<P>The authors then did a detailed evaluation of the construal, parameter, and tuning theories. As they see it, the different head choices argue against the aspect of the garden-path theory that predicts similar principles governing head choice in all languages. As for the refined garden-path theory, the authors saw no evidence for the reanalysis process proposed by that theory, or for semantic bias, noting that when subject-verb agreement and gender agreement lead them to a different answer from English high-attachment or Spanish low-attachment, reading times increased. </P>

<P>As for construal theory, they attribute the results to the exception that the writer makes a clear sentence, and to the confusion between the Norman genitive (the servant of the actress) and the Saxon genitive (the actress&iacute; servant) in English. As they see it, the reader then concludes the author intended for the subject to be &euml;actress&iacute; rather than &euml;servant.&iacute; However, Dutch and German, both with Saxon and Norman genitives, pick low-attachment heads. </P>

<P>While the construal theory idea of a modifier attaching itself to the entire theta domain, with decisions made depending on the existence of alternative hosts explains some sentence choices studied, there was no full-scale reanalysis on the reader&iacute;s part as predicted, suggesting the resolution is still incomplete. </P>

<P>Parameter theories speculate that the late closure strategy and attaching post-positioned modifiers to NP strategy competed for sentence understanding. However, in Dutch and Italian, predictions on what strategy would be used as contradicted, with Dutch using the modifier strategy even without postnominal adjectives, and Italian preferring the late closure and low-attachment strategy even with postnominal adjectives. Other strategies proposed do not seem to fit, but there are more proposed by parameter theorists. Bilinguals and monolinguals of different languages reading ambigious sentences may be one of the research groups that parameter theorists may want to study in detail.</P>

<P>Finally, tuning theories seem to do well in explaining the data.  Largely, the tuning theory looks at resolution alternatives in the corpus, and more local bias. The biggest predication is when readers are exposed to an unusual amount of one ambiguity resolution, they will either choose that one, or have a hard time deciding what resolutions they are used to seeing and what they are now seeing. As it turns out, high-attachment was prevalent in English while in Spanish the attachment was reversed. </P>

<P>The tuning model also predicts when readers are starting out, they are unbiased in their choice of attachment and resolution, and as they are exposed to more sentences in the language, they lean toward one or the other. The studies with Spanish and English children seem to support that claim, starting out as choosing either high or low-attachment equally, and English-speaking children leaning toward high-attachment as they get older, while Spanish-speaking children are the opposite. However, it is not yet known at what level of detail are these internal corpuses kept. </P>

<P>While conclusions of Cuetos, Mitchell, and Corley seem solid, something bugs me. I had a different answer, as apparently did 26% of the English-speaking subjects, and performaning differently from Spanish-English bilinguals, chosing the low-attachment resolution for both. THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL JUDGMENT STUDIES, NOT JUST THIS ONE -- PEOPLE ARE RECALCITRANTLY UNWILLING TO BEHAVE THE WAY THAT LINGUISTS WANT.   I will say for English, however, I could have chosen &euml;the actress,&iacute; the high-attachment head, and it would still be right. I am not sure if I would make the same judgment for the Spanish sentence.  WELL, AS I TOLD YOU, BILINGUALS RARELY BEHAVE LIKE TWO MONOLINGUALS IN ONE HEAD!!</P>

<P>Also, I do wonder about one objection to the tuning theory the authors brought up, that it might be impossible to falsify the hypothesis. However, if it turns out that corpus statistics and behavioral evidence do not have the same level of detail or grain pattern, it may be possible to falsify. Also, what restrictions on varying grain are there? Possibly, further tests in other languages, especially with the corpus of Dutch and German, and theoretical speculation on the level of detail could bring answers.</P>

<P>I suspect it could be nicely explained by three possibilities: 1) late bilinguals choosing one strategy and sticking to it due to verbal conservatism, 2) being exposed to sentences resolved by low-attachment more often in Spanish, and high and low-attachment almost equally in English, I just happened to chose both for both sentences, and 3) somehow in the choice between Norman and Saxon genitives, I chose the Norman, due to being in school for too long. In other words, I am wondering which explains my odd answers more, the parameter theory or the tuning theory.  </P>

<P>Cross-linguistic studies in aphasia</P>

<P>With studies of both Broca and Wernike&iacute;s aphasia in Italian, German, and English, and some reference to studies in Turkish and Hungarian, Bates and Wulfeck came to four conclusions: the &euml;same&iacute; symptoms look different in different languages; inflections and function words are selectively impaired in comprehension and production; this does not occur just in Broca&iacute;s aphasiacs, long thought to be suffering from &euml;agrammaticism,&iacute; but in every language impairment syndrome, and even a few problems that have nothing to do with language (such as hip surgery); and the problem is not loss, but accessing, with patients showing an ability to retrieve and use morphological patterns correctly when given enough input. </P>

<P>With the different unresolved issues noted by the researchers, could other theories of language acquisition and disorder come close? While the findings are framed in the Competition Model, I cannot help but wonder what other theorists looked at the aphasiacs. What would they generalize, and would be robust for most aphasiacs in different languages?</P>

<P>Also interesting was the possible link between stress and loss of closed-class words. If physical stress of any sort leads to that, what results would mental and emotional stress have? Would, for instance, people with clinical depression obtain those same results, or have troubles in some area? Would they even have troubles at all? Perhaps reviewing any literature on language use and deviations by patients with schizophrenia and other mental disorders, plus some studies on people diagnosed with clinical depression and bi-polar disorder may find links, if any, between distress and language disorder.</P>

<P>I'D HAVE LIKED A LITTLE MORE INTEGRATION ACROSS THESE THREE DISCUSSIONS, BUT THE PAPER STILL QUALIFIES FOR AN A</P></FONT>
