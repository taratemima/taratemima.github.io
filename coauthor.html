<body>
A long time ago, in a suburb far far away, there was
raised a boy. This boy's name was Rob.
<p>
With little inkling of the social neo-deviant he would grow into,
Rob grew up in the small town of Hopewell Junction (
yes - it's true, it's true). And went to high school
there before entering Eastern Nazarene College at the
ade of 19. 
<p>
He graduated for the last time 1995, now
possessing his Bachelor's degree and his Associates
degree. (Coincidentally, he also possessed an aversion
to the nazarene faith which endures to this day - Rob
long ago came out of the broom closet.) Later on, Rob
attended Computer Ed institute in Somerville,
Massachusetts, and gained his Cerificate in Computer
Programming. 
<p>
Along the way, Rob held many jobs,
ranging from carnie to security guard to pizza guy to
barista - the last where he met the woman he would
soon marry, one Susan Moura. <p>
Rob now lives in Quincy
with his wife and two cats, and a constant struggle
for dominance is ongoing. The cats are winning.
