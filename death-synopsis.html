<head><title>Synopsis of A Little Death</title></head>
<body>
Death walks in human form.
<p>
The trouble is, there are many versions of death, and no one knows which one will descend, or in what body. When does the person's will becomes submerges in the entity? And who will they leave behind?
<p>
David has been charged with guarding Death's form (at least in Chicago), no matter what. He has a thriving business, a man who loves him named Tom, a mother in the hospital to take care of, and a meddling sister named Shiri. Life was normal.
<p>
No one knows what form Death will take. When an shy, eager and innocent art school student named Mala is chosen, David and Tom find everything they think about love questioned.
<p>
No one knows what lives Death remembers. When a lover, an incarnation called Decay, comes to find her, David and Tom find they have to fight for Mala's body and mind. They find unexpected help in Gabriel, Shiri's new love, and an incarnation also called Healing.
<p>
The plan is to have five issues of the first story, and a separate issue for 'the good parts.' Heh heh, you'll have to be patient for that. Much will be discussed about Mala's switching between herself and Death and the nature of the incarnations. Mallette and I have three episode ideas so far, but I much rather take it one issue at a time.
<p>
If this gets some fans, I would like to sell t-shirts. Maybe mugs. I mean, if anyone wants to wear them on their bodies. Not mugs, of course.
