	Actually, I'd like to give my thoughts on the mass suicide right
now (as you can guess, I didn't get your message until now).
</p>
		<ol>
<li>It was incredibly morbid seeing all those bodies in San Diego covered
	in purple, with indentical black shoes and pants.</li>
<li>It is especially significant to me that the people in that UFO worship
cult were involved with computers (the Glob had them down as programmers;
Fox News had down as webpage developers). It seems that the techies among
us like to think of themselves as skeptical, sardonic (i.e.,
Discordianism), and above all the nonsense about unexplainable things.
However, they are, I think, just as inclined to blindness to other points
of view when their dogma is concerned. I can't really articulate it.
</li>
<li>I just *loved* the coverage on cults. They started with a
straight-faced discussion of "Satanic cults," and express shock that you
could get information about it on *the Internet*. Yes, and you can
get information on Judaism, Islam, Paganism on the Internet too. They
showed a picture of Anton LaVey. Gods, the only diety that the Church of
Satan worships is themselves, and they make that pretty clear. They also
make a point of distancing themselves from "devil-worship" cults. Matt
Paradise (media representive for the CoS), where are you when they need
you? I don't see eye-to-eye at all with (CoS), but media sensationalism
just makes me puke). 
</li>
<li>And oh boy, another kid lured by an on-line stalker story. What I want
to know is, why is a 14-year-old carrying on with an older man? It doesn't
matter if she met him in a chat room or at a party. That fact sends
shivers, not the fact that she met him in that awful Internet (ever notice
how often TV news mentions how evil the Internet is at least once?
Wouldn't want any competition, eh?).
</li>
<li>Good Friday got me to thinking of death, and of apocalypse. If it ever
comes, it will be because humans want it to come, *need* it to come. I'm
remembering a poem written from a point of a Roman senator finding out
that the barbarians were coming to Rome. When news comes that they left,
he said "Why did they? They were kind of a solution." That is exactly what
we, at the close of the millenium, want. Unlike our ancestors at 1000 CE,
we have the means to stage a real life apocalypse, with epic good and evil
battles on pay-per-view. 
</li>
<li>Jesus was the greatest satirist on religion, and L. Ron Hubbard and
Aliester Crowley follow in the same tradition. Unfortunately, some of
their biggest fans don't get the joke.
</li>

I've said too much, I haven't said enough,<br>
