Far Too Frail is the tenative title for a novel I'm writing. I say tenative because 
I am not sure of the copyright issues involved with naming a book after a song. 
*heh* 
<p>
It's a long-view of a hypothetical drug involving a symbiote and a prescription drug, and the small group of friends affected by it, as users or as observers. 
<P>
After it is written? I don't know. I imagine that being new and having very little printed will get me rejection notices, but I would be curious what the rejection would be for. I am serious considering self-publishing. However, I will have to think of getting a solid customer base (you know, people interested in the book), before doing that.
<p>
<h5>Synposis</h5>
<P>
Emily thinks that her roommate, Alice, is acting strangely. Meanwhile Alice's S.O., Isabel, is worried about Alice, knowing first hand how addictive and alienating what Alice is experiencing is.
<p>
Meanwhile, Sam is feeling calmer than he ever did, even with his company in a war and the IRS hunting him down. After all, the being inside him will make him work faster, better, as long as he gives it just what it needs.
<P>
A rare symbiote and a prescription drug combine to form the hottest drug for fast-coding dotcoms and cutting edge academic research.
<p>
The ultimate smart drug--but what is the cost?
