Subject: RANT: the foul stench of the <a
href="http://www.christiangallery.com">christian gallery</a>
<p>
I don't know about all of you, but I felt the decay of moral
feeling while looking at www.christiangallery.com. I sensed the glee they
seem to take in the prospect of destruction in the name of the so-called
Prince of Peace. If they take to stalking people who work at abortion
clinics, are they going after people who provide birth control? Me? You?
People with strange-colored hair? Who will they go after, and what will
they do to them?<p>
They seem obsessed, more obsessed with sin, the idea of even
thinking of deviating from an impossibly narrow straight path, than even
their worse imaginings of pagans, homosexuals, liberals, etc. Satan is as
powerful as God to them, and seem to talk about him and fear him more than
their supposed 'Lord.' These guys seem to be *true* Satanists, none of
that androcentric {should have been 'anthrocentric,' or something like that--tae} LaVey weinie-ism. They treat that guy with the horns
with <i>respect</i>. <p>
I fear their world coming about, but not just because of the
inevitable persceutations. I fear justice being twisted into grudges,
steadfastness turned into arrogance, and the hope of heaven turned to hell
on earth. I fear imagination and curiosity not servicing their version of
Christianity killed off. Maybe it's already happened.<p> 
And what will the people who wrote the Christian Gallery do if
they find that they are punished just as brutally as they punished those
they hated, assuming that there is an afterlife? Whether he <i>is</i> God
I don't know, but there's a certain poetic justice to the thought of the
Jesus they claim to love and serve screaming 'Get out of my sight! I was
hungry and you did not feed me . . ." <p>
I noticed that most of the membership of the radical religious
right comes from the midwest and the south (I think that the web site
mentioned being based in Georgia)--it's almost as if in retalation
for being underestimated so long, they will destroy anything that they
don't understand. <p>
And there may be no heaven to punish them for their spawning of
hellfire.<p>
