<h3>A Trip to Babylon : An Account of Traveling to and in New York</h3>
<p>
Holy shit, I thought as I walked up the stairs in Kenmore Station, first 
time I'm going to New York and I'm what--ten minutes late?!
 When will that 57 bus come? I would walk to Brighton Ave, but with all the 
construction, I wouldn't be surprised if I took a wrong turn and ended up at 
Southie!<p>  
I was going to help out the Woman of Sodom at a performance in New York. I got up, got dressed, left Cindy's phone number, ate, and thought that I had all the time in the world. By the time I got to Quincy Center, it was 11:20. Riding to Park Street took 
30 minutes, to Kenmore 15, and the bus ride five minutes.<p>
It seem obivous to me I was fucked. Winding down Gardner and other random streets, I was hot and terrified. I knew that driving would take a long time and I didn't want to hold up anyone. I didn't want to be a burden.<p>
I knock and found a couple of the members eating bananas and watching the 12 o'clock news. Jerry Garcia died, according to the broadcast. I don't imagine that Deadheads are too distraught--they can always follow Phish. A picture of Mariah Carey was sh
own. People were wondering if she killed a dog with her singing, her husband with an axe, or a bit of both.<p>
Finally we all got into the car. What, Adam wasn't going, Cindy? Goody.<p>	<dd>Everyone was reminded of a field trip: the provisions for equipment and luggage, the big, simple, red and white bus with high stairs, the single lines, the obsecenely sunny
 day. A roll call of sorts must be given: Cindy, Xavier, Nilia, Bina, me, Larrisa, Jen, Mike, Harry, Tom, and Melissa. The air conditioner took a while to get going. As it started up, we were on our way.<p>
Ooops! Some business had to be taken care of. The bus was parked outside while money, record sleeves, and food were sought after. Fortunately, those remaining were suffiently entertained. Sweet and Nasty, a shop specializing in "X-rated chocolates and
 cakes," was just outside. It was great. People would rubberneck to look at the display. Girls with long boxes walked out. A tourist like group of people were window shopping and took a looooooong look at the display. We were all amused. We probably would
n't
 have hooted and stared if the windows weren't tinted from the outside, but what the hell?<p>
Off we all went sharing ice coffee and scones to the tune of Erasure doing ABBA. Nothing but roads and trees. To pass some time, I studied some of my Russian. Larrissa said that the only word I needed to learn is tsarveg(?)--bastard. The DAT tape for 
the
 performance was being played. It was interesting to hear the music without vocals. I never noticed the low sliding sample in "Witches, Bitches, and Psychos" or the guitar note changes in "Behind the Door"--or am I hallunicating? Larrissa was flabbergaste
d that Tom and I could repeat about all her lyrics off the top of our heads ("Take a good fucking look!"). Cindy remarks that the reason why she gives Larrissa all the songs with swears is that she can do them so well. I remembered something I read about 

how the Russian language had so many swears and the causualness that Russian-speakers use those words. I also remembered Steve and his dictionary of Russian obscenities. Perhaps it would be interesting to see Larrissa and Steve swear at each other.<p>
Allen Ginsburg came on. I really don't know what to think of him. The left side of my brain really doesn't think that this shit makes sense, while the  right side of my brain thinks it makes perfect sense. The right side also thinks that Ginsburg sounds like a Muppet. So did Tom. In fact, how about a new resident on Seasame Street--Allen the Lion, the lovable, gullible (if you read anything about how his aquittances and friends treated him, you'd understand why I used "gullible"), poetry-reciting lion
 who lives next to Oscar the Grouch and 
Big Bird to grok (my words, not his) the fullness of existance. Madonna also came on, and the whole time I was waiting for "Erotica" to come on for some odd reason. We kept daring Cindy to moon truck drivers ("When I wanna listen to bondage music, I liste
n to the Women of Sa-dom"). Cindy passed along a record single to some guys in an old trailer with a "Billy Bob and the Killbillies" sticker on it.<p> 
It was time to eat. I felt like an scrub. I left my credit card in the car, but it looked like the diner didn't take it anyway. I had no money, yet I ordered a cheese burger and tonic. Everyone else was still in breakfast mode and ordered omelets and 
such. No matter how I tried to enjoy myself, I felt so guilty. I was vaguely relieved that we left.<p>
Down we drove through Connecticut. Nine Inch Nails was playing in the car, and I was indifferent to the two versions of "Closer" that were being played. Cindy wanted to cover that song, since it always made her violent. It always made me think of Tony
 doing the line "I wanna fuck you like an animal" in his William Shatner voice. I also noticed that there weren't any screams of "Suck! Suck! Suck!" during "Suck" like there was in the live version. We got off at a rest stop to make bathroom stops. Severa
l men in suits gawked at us--or was my vision bad? A blonde female mundane looked at us and made a "look at <em>those</em> people" sneer. I just gave her a quizicial(sp?) look. Who died and made her goddess? Cindy (Larrissa? Jen?) said I should have given
 her a sneer back, but I don't care. She's a fool. <p> 
"Welcome to New York" the sign said. The sun was very bright, people were sleeping, and I feeling lonely and was wondering what White Plains was like. I had some experiences with suburbs. I've seen kids from Milton and Quincy drink, smoke, and take dr
ugs at a young age. I'
ve heard of people going crazy and killing everyone at a random shopping mall. I have seen the lack of interesting sites--libraries, record stores, diners--in rural New Jersey. I'll tell you, suburbs are no places to raise kids.<p>
I'm not sure what happened when we got near the series of bridges. I remember that they had trouble deciding which bridge was "their friend." We passed by the Harlem River, some people who looked like they had no place to go to ever, and a man selling
 celluar phones. Some people were worried about not getting their beer, and Larrissa wished that we stopped at a Popeye's in Massachusetts to get spicy fries. Where do we go the Triboro or FDR? It turn out okay, we made it into Manhattan. The skyline look
ed like sun-baked clay, a decadent city from another time. What will they say in the future as they look at  one of the world's biggest cities? What will they say of us in the future?<p>
The traffic was unbelievable. The pedestrains were so presumptous. What, they thought that by the grace of their favorite deity they won't get hit by cabdrivers? I was reminded of Boston, except the streets were wider, the place was dirtier, and there
 were people selling stuff on street corners. Jen, Harry, and some others were gawking at the women in short skirts. Frankly, I didn't notice--I'm a hair person. Harry was amazed : "All the normal women think I'm a pig." We caught a glimpse of Broadway. S
omeone said "I know a new direction for us--showtunes!!" What, "Anything Goes"?<p>
We made it to Roseland ballroom. The band all met the promoter in the entry. He had a Bart Simpson t-shirt and Itchy and Scratchy boxer shorts. Now he is wearing black socks with sandals. A true fashion plate.<p>
There was still time. Harry and Xavier got the equipment out of the car, and we all got passes. Our dressing room was a medium-sized basement room in the club's basement. The bathroom was unisex and looked threatening.<p>
We got dressed. I was the first to get ready. I feel better when I get myself ready and I can get my enema filled up. I start off by filling my enema bag. Then I change out of my clothes into a flimsy white neligee (I think that's what its called). I wasn't sure whether or not to wear tights--I feel a little embrassessed without them, but my underwear was sticking out of the tigh
ts and I was getting a wedgie. Everyone else put on costumes and make-up. Conversations went around. "Whose going to wear the dildo?" "The bathroom is gross." Oh, and after a nice club employee made the trip to the liquor store, they did get their beer.<p>
What? It's time?!? We all got out there. Shit, five minutes behind! And where's Mike? Does he have his costume on? Fortunately, Melissa got out there and sang the intro. A guy backstage commented on my outfit. When I looked embrassessed, he apologized
. I don't know whether to feel vindicated or stupid.<p>
So I waited. The order of the songs are very familiar to me. First the intro, then "Witch, Bitch, and Psycho", then "Boots", then "Behind the Door." I knew what was happening even though I was hidden by the curtain. Kissing people, beating up men, locking guys in the cage, the usual good clean family fun.I checked behind the curtain though, once to see if Mike is there, once to see who were those kids screaming "It's Frazier!" and "Hit him harder!," and once to see who is on the cage. Nilia forgot
 her camera, which I immediately relayed to her. I accidently split beer on Larrissa's jacket, which I immediately wiped off and put in the hamper.<p>
Yep, it's about time. I got my enema, and I am standing near the curtain to the amused interest of the VIP tables. About the time Cindy said "My assistant has prepared you for the exam," I moved up to her. Waitasec, aren't we supposed to give Mike the
 enema? That's Tom on top of the cage?! Oh well, can't say anything now. So I do my thing (get wet, lick the water off Cindy, go over to the cage, try not to giggle audiably). And it's over. I throw off my gloves to the tune of "Eeeeewwwww, gross!"<p>
So I got dress, talked, then cleared out when Fallen Angels/Digital Orgasm, the people sharing our oh-so-spacious dressing room, got in. I went up to see the rest of the show. Hey, where's everybody else? Oh well, let's talk about My Life With the Thrill Kill 
Kult. Lots of lights, lots of lam&eacute costumes, weird conglomarate of early 60s instruments and dance beats. They must wish their life was "The Acid Eaters." Hey, there's Larrissa and Jen. Oh, and Tom is talking to someone. Nilia is with Bina. 
6 out of 11 isn't bad.<p>
After a dizzying set (with two encores), the house lights came on. Tom talked to some people. We met some people who wanted to meet the Women of Sodom. Well, here we are. I wasn't introduced until a little later. Oh suuuuuure, ignore the enema girl *grin*.<p>
Now Fallen Angels/Digital Orgasm came on. What good thing can I say about them? Ummmmmmmm, they have good taste in industrial music? To quote Tom's sarcastic assessment "I love how they did <em>all</em> their music, their coherant storyline, their <em>original</em> show imagery, and their <em>diverse racial mix
</em>."<p>
Lords of Acid--what can I say about them? Well, I know now who did "Rough Sex." Nice neon stage set, some songs with drug and sex references (I like the songs about sex better, but that's just my vice), hilarous opening song (the "ET" theme intersperced with sex sounds). The lead singer was an object of amusement for us. She was known by several names: "the blonde Flemish Madonna-wannabe bimbette," "a cross between 'I Dream of Jeannie' and Barbie," "a wind-up doll that says something sexual everytime you pulled the string," and "an insult to Madonna." But who cares about that silly girl? Larrissa, Tom, Jen, Bina, Nilia, and I were having too much fun dancing in a circle, arms interlinked. Nilia was flirting with avilable men and Bina. The rest of us were kissing each other. Is it hot in here? Christ, I wish had
 something other than shorts and t-shirt to change in--I was soaked.<p>
I went in the dressing room to get my stuff. I saw Xavier and Cindy and some other people, including Jeff, who was with Lords of Acid. She dared me and him to kiss. "C'mon, feel her breast, it's really big." Oh, whatever, he doesn't seem too bad. Cindy was in a voyeuristic mood. She got Xavier and Jeff to kiss each other (Xavier slipping Jeff the tongue). I'd much rather kiss her, and I told her so. She laughed--I blushed. She tried to get me, Bina, and Nilia to have a make-out train. Then she tried to have someone remove the duct tape from some Fallen Angel's breast. I wasn't interested in either, so I teased her, wondering when she'll do something. Tom joined in. "Oh, I see you're all talk." So, with only me, Tom, and Xavier looking, she flashed her
 breast. Now it is time to go. As some of us waited for the van to be packed up, I picked up some brightly colored techno magazine with Milla on the cover. I walked to a noisy scene. Tom played piano, Nilia and Jen was singing, and Cindy was on top of the
 piano, slinking around, caressing herself. I joined in. We were doing "Like A Virgin." When the verse "touched for the very first time," Cindy yelled "fucked" in place of "touched."<p>        
Let's see, we are supposed to go to some party with the other acts. Now where is it? As I followed dutifully, I realized that I could care less about this party, that my main concern was getting something to eat. My main concern was not getting lost on streets with numbers for names instead of words. Mike and I, being the tourists we were, sang 'New York, New York.' After a space of time, gossip about the bands ("God Lives Underwater is not our friend"), discussions about cheesy Japanese shows,  and some experiences of bad driving, we got to the club. It was in the meat market district. It was also an sm bar. None of the bands, but full of clueless old men. Xavier got me a glass of water. Some guy tried to touch me, but stopped when I gave him a nasty look. I wondered when we were going to get out of here. Fortunately
y, others were thinking the same thing. They really wanted to get out after Cindy, Jen, and Larrissa was asked to chain some relucant, squirming dude. Later I found out that John Zewizz did not want to play at this particular club because "there were all these glory
 holes and stuff." Harry and Nilia were offered a thousand dollars if they had sex in front of some guy. I was real glad to get out of there. Does that say anything about me?<p>
We searched for something to eat. We stopped at something called Empire Diner. Very beautiful silver train car design with candles and bathroom inside. However, we all balked at the prices. Once again, I forgot my credit card. I vowed to myself that I
 will get just a tonic (which came with a lemon), but I was hungry. Jen offered to pay for something if I promise to pay her back, so I got some French fries. I wanted to offer to pay for the meals with my card, but I was so scared that people will wonder
 why I got a meal at the diner at the highway. I felt like such an idiot. The fries turned out to be circular and very good. In fact, people raved about the food. I was still thirsty, so I asked Tom to get me a Coke. One more person to pay off. We all dec
ided to head home.<p>     
After we got in the car, I cuddled into my seat and fell asleep. I wished that a some people I have a crush on were beside. I wished that I let Cindy sit next to me. I half-awakeningly touched Melissa's arm, causing her to flinch. Jeez, idiot awake, idiot
 half-awake. I feel back to sleep. Waking back up, I saw bright lights and a cool drink. We stopped at gas station and wondered what time it is. As I kept awake, I saw country roads and the appoarching dawn as I sucked down my drink. Cindy's slender body 
slid under the seats so she could streached her legs. Are we in Massachuttes yet?<p>
After a while, while listening to a Tom-initated discussion, I saw the sign "Welcome to Massachusetts." So we are here. Through the Mass Pike, through Newton or so, to Brighton/Allston. We came to Cindy's house. I changed into shorts and shirt and rode with Jen and Mike to the trolley stop. Jen and Mike talked quietly on the Green Line train while I slipped in and out of sleep. I said goodbye and caught my train. I fell asleep and missed my stop on the Red Line. I woke up and saw industrial parks. O shit, I thought, what stop is this? I heard "Entering Braintree, last stop." I got a train to my stop. All this cost me thirty minutes, I thought as I got my bus. I need to get some more sleep, I thought. I also realized that I needed to write all this do
wn.<p>
