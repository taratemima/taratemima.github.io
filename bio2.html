<title>Random mutterings . . .</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
Some additional things about me:
<P>
I have <a href="http://add.about.com/">Attention Deficit Disorder</a> and <a href="http://www.udel.edu/bkirby/asperger/">Asperger's Disorder</a> 
<p>
I want to have more visual content of my own, but I stink at photography and just learning Photoshop. Them pretty gawthic layered photos will just have to wait. :)
<P>
I'm sometimes <a href="http://www.brunching.com">silly</a> and hungry for <a href="http://www.amused.com/">amusement</a> . 
<p>
I'm Ennegram <a href="http://www.best.com/~asci4d/enneagram/point4.htm">Type 4</a> with a <a href="http://www.best.com/~asci4d/enneagram/point5.htm">Five wing</a>  and <a href="http://typelogic.com/infp.html">INFP</a>.  
<p>
I vacillate between too much information and not enough.
<p> 
I hope to work in some field involving <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org">language</a>  and <a href="http://www.acm.org">computers</a> .
<p>
I play some piano, keyboards, and accordian. I hope to record an album.
<p>
Not sure why I have few web awards, when every web page with a blood bar has them. Maybe I need to sign some guestbooks. I'm also not comfortable with blatant self-promotion, although I am willing to nominate myself for funny awards. I take comfort in <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Metro/1301/">Charles Baudelaire</a> when he says "Prizes bring bad luck. Academic prizes, decorations, all those inventions of the devil encourage hypocrisy and freeze the spontaneous upsurge of a free heart."
<p>
I dislike the some goths' attitude of "We got both kinds of music here--gothic and industrial." Fortunately, I encounter that rarely.
<p>
I don't speak much, have iffy social skills, and find large, loud parties frustrating and frightening. I think obsessing over your standing in the local club is one of those 'old skool' traditions that needs to be thrown off. Dressing well and actually reading '<a href="http://www.gothic.net/poe/">gothic literature</a>' (I don't mean Anne Rice, dammit!!) needs to be revived.
<p>
I still need to work on my <a href="http://sinister.com/atrocities">wardrobe</a> .
<p>
I loved vampire movies as a kid, and perfer the fictional kind to some of the schmucks running <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~vamphuntb">around</a> .
<p>
Religion has already fascinated me. After deciding the concepts handed to me wasn't for me (recovering Catholic, if you care), the desire for meaning still remains. Only now I realize it can only be meaning for *me*, and not necessarily for everyone else. I'm still searching.
<P> 
<a href="http://www.avatarsearch.com">Magic</a> (with a k, if you insist) may or may not exist, but I have more urgent things to do than find out.
<p>
I may never get published (in book form), but I still have fun writing. Writing fiction is the only way you can have 'imaginary friends' as a grown-up.
<p>
Yeah, some of my friends and acquaintances look like [insert derisive term for subculture you don't like]. They're nice and intelligent people, though. I tend to go for people with brains than any subcultural affliation. I have my prejudices too, but I'm working on it.
