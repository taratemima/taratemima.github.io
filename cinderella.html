<P>
        Once upon a time that a good number of people have forgotten about, 
there lived a girl named Cinderella. Perhaps you have heard? Her kind father 
had died, leaving her with a stepmother and stepsisters. They contented 
themselves with the strange business of "finding a husband." Cinderella, being
 confused by the quest for martimony and more attractive than her stepsisters,
 was in the way. And they never let her forget it. 
<P>
        Her life changed from comfort to pain. At dawn, she would be 
woken up by her stepmother shouting "Cinderella, there's work to be done, 
you stupid rat!" After putting her torn cloak over rags, she would go 
down from her austere attic room to sweep floors of the grand house. 
After, she would climb to the roof to clean out the chimeny, trying to 
keep her balance among the harsh winds. Coming down, she would go into 
the kitchen to make tea and pastry for breakfast, amid mutters of 
conversations and occasional snappish remarks about 'the slow brat.' She 
walked up the stairs as they gorged themselves. She had no time or 
inclination to--she has to get their day clothes ready.<p>
	After laying out dresses, she would take out hair accessories. 
Annalissa, the oldest of the two daughters, came into the room cross. "I 
couldn't sleep at all, what with all those rats meeping. Obviously, you 
have not used the arsenic." Cinderella nodded meekly. "Oh, I do. They 
just tend to avoid it." "If this continues, the rats will be chased 
out of this house--along with you!" Cinderella whispered, "The arsenic 
will be used, Annalissa." Cinderella got a comb and started to 
straighten Annalissa's hair. "Oh! Ow! Stop it, it hurts!," Annalissa 
shouted. "Well, stay still and it will be over soon." Annalissa 
suddenly grabbed a brush and screamed "Don't tell me what to do, you 
attic rat!" She then smacked Cinderella several times with her brush, 
beating her on the head, the arms and the shoulders. After Annalissa 
got tired from it, she snarled "Get me into my dress and petticoat, and 
then brush my hair." Cinderella then helped Annalissa into her 
underwear and gown. Afterwards, she brushed Annalissa's hair, gently taking 
care of the snarls with her fingers.<p>
	Olivia was next, and was in a slightly sour mood than Annalissa.       
As Cinderella got Olivia dressed, she didn't notice Olivia grabbing a hot 
pocker from the fireplace. "Lie down on the bed," Olivia hissed. 
Cinderella just did what she was told. She did not cry out as Olivia took 
off her torn dress and traced the hot poker on her skin. Olivia always 
muttered during this torture sessions, "time to bring all this fat 
away--you are obviously eating too much, you lazy cow." The one time 
she did try to scream, when Olivia placed the tip of the pocker on her 
nipple, Olivia's hand clasped over Cinderella's mouth. Olivia then threw 
the poker back into the fire place and slapped Cinderella. "Get dressed," 
Olivia whispered as Cinderella tried to get her clothes on, just as her 
stepmother was calling her to clean the parlor.  
<P>
        In between meals, she would have to clean various parts of the house. 
Sometimes when the stepsisters are feeling especially bored, they would 
"accidently" knock over their tea on a freshly cleaned spot. 
<P>
        After it was all finished, the only peace she has is late at night, 
while eating her one meal of the day, pale soup and dry bread. She 
started praying that night like she always did. "Pere Notre . . .Ave 
Marie . . ." Tonight, however, it was just hopeless. After trying to tell 
God to bless Mother, Olivia, and Annalissa, Cinderella broke down 
weeping. A small, brown familiar face came up. "Dontien!," she cried out. 
She rescued Dontien from a trap when he was a small rat. Now he and his 
now large family has come to visit. They have not forgotten that she has 
led them away from the arsenic-laced food. So, they came to hear pour out 
the prayers no god seems to hear. 
<P>
        She told them not only of her sorrows, but of her 
observations. All of the effort of the stepsisters was to the task of finding a 
wealthy husband. When bands of gypsies come around offering powders for clear,
 pale skin and dye to turn hair red and blonde, the stepsisters would 
shriek and push Cinderella out the door to greet the sellers. When the powders
 fail to make their acne-ridden skin clear or their brown hair bewitching 
colors, Cinderella bared the blunt of the sisters' frustration.
<P>
        There were other ways to refinement though. On Wedsnesdays, the shrill
 voices of the girls sang madgrials. On Fridays, the stepmother wrangled for 
invitations to dances. On Sundays, they would dress in brightly colored 
taffeta, give large tithes, and gossip about their neighbors during the sermon.
<P>
        All she could say to this was "Yes, Mother. Yes, Annalisa. Yes, Olivia.
 It shall be done."
<P>
        Days went by and winter couglated into spring. The stepmother and 
stepsisters now demanded cool drinks with their meals. Often, Cinderella heard
 the click of locked doors as they offered their limited charms to gentlemen 
with oily hair and drawls willing to sit bored while the girls showed off
 their limited knowledge. For what? A grope, a quick dalliance, the vain hope 
for a wealthy husband. During one of these visits, Cinderella got an message 
from a young squire. After the strange
 hoots and hollers died down in the room, she presented the message to the 
stepsisters.
<P>
        Upon opening the door, the girls started meeping and shrieking like 
the rats when they are caught in the cage. "A ball! For the prince! Eligible 
maidens to attend! What a fine husband he will be! The prince! Cinderella, you
 stupid girl, what are you doing standing there? Get our dresses! Our jewels! 
And HURRY!" Cinderella knew it was useless to ask if she can go, considering 
the remarks the girls had made in the past about her, so she drifted to the 
stepsisters'chambers.
<P>
        As the stepsisters tossed and proclaimed various babbles and fabrics 
"useless" and "ugly," the rats quietly carried the rejected items to 
Cinderella's room. When she came back after a tiring day, she was surprised at
 what her rat friends had brought her. Bright satins, soft silks, ornate 
brocades, pearls and rubies, and a slightly battered looking grey cloak. They
 meeped, as if they wanted Cinderella to wear these beautiful things right 
this minute. She just put her finger to her lips and whispered "In good time 
my dear friends." A scream sailed up the stairs after that, startling some of 
the baby rats. "But first, I must make supper. This is especially important, 
being the night of the royal ball. And please don't squeek like that, Dontien 
, you will get your supper *very* soon." 
<P>
        For an hour, Cinderella baked, mixed, and cooked in a steamy kitchen,
 lifting heavy pots and full bowls. She put many spice mixtures in the dishes,
 especially something from a long grey bottle. She worked quietly while the 
stepsisters talked loudly about nothing at all.
<p>
        "Well, I don't think . . ." Olivia crowed.<p>
        "How many months *were* there between the wedding and the birth of the
 son?," Annalisa said with ill-concealed malice.<p>
        "Well," Olivia, "I heard this from a reliable source." Then in the 
stage whisper, she said "five"<p>
        The girls then crackled. The stepmother sat there and said "Cinderella,
 are you finished in there. The ball is in two hours, and we don't want to 
wait that long for our soup."<p>
        "Of course, Mother."<p>
        "And I hope you don't put too much pepper in it like you did the last 
time, you ugly thing. I sneezed insuffereably!"<p>
        "No, Olivia. There is no pepper."<p> 
        Finally, she served the supper.<p> 
        Soft rolls and barley soup with red wine was first. The girls slurped 
the soup and chomped on the bread. They later demanded seconds. The 
stepmother repeatly asked for various spices. "There just is not enough," she 
chirped.
<P>
        The fish came next, pink against a silver platter. Annalisa and the 
stepmother tore into the fish, but Olivia shrieked that she hated fish. She 
grabbed Cinderella by the hair and screamed that she was "an incompentant 
fool" before eating the fish.
<P>
        The chicken, shimmering brown with fresh string beans, was a 
masterpiece. Cinderella was often summoned to carve large pieces for the 
steprelatives.
<P>
        For dessert, sweet raspberry filled pastry with sugary icing. Olivia 
nibbled, while Annalisa took large bites, and the stepmother chewed almost 
thoughtfully her piece.  Cinderella stood there by the table, waiting for the 
next command. The stepmother turned to her and yelled "Well, go! Take your 
bread and water. You'll have none of this. We need our strength after all for 
dancing. And wash the windows in the meantime. We'll call you when we need 
more." Cinderella nodded and walked to the parlor. 
<P>
        Cinderella was finishing on the east bay windows when she heard 
strangled cries and the clanging of dishes. She walked in carefully and 
surveyed the scene with a poker face. The stepmother, in her dark purple dress
 and pearls, was face first in the chicken. Annalissa fell near the parlor 
door, in a green dress showing off what little cleavage she had. Olivia 
was slumped in her chair, wearing pink and too many diamonds. Red wine was 
spilled all over the rug. She shook her head and muttered "Pity" as she 
cleared the food and washed off the wine. 
<P>
        She went into the kitchen to get the long grey bottle. "Arsenic. They 
tried to kill my friends with it. I am surprised they did not catch me. But I 
suppose that when all you talk about gossip, what your _maid_ does is not 
important." 
<P>
        Walking up to the attic, she opened the door. "Come out, friends, 
supper is served," she cried. The rats spilled out as Cinderella watched them.
 She stood there thinking of what to wear to the ball as the hungry rats ate 
into the exposed flesh of the steprelatives. "Oh. It is almost time for the 
ball, and I must get dressed" she murmured as she ran up the attic stairs.
