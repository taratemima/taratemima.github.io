Concerta For the Lost and Found<br>
by Tara<br>
Allies lost and found again. (NC-17)
<p>
NC-17 for sex, death, bigotry, and fear. If you see the names ‘Danny’ and ‘Tim,’ understand that these are alternate universe versions of them, not the real thing. I mixed in fact in here, but it is mostly fiction. 
<p>
I have a lot of projects to complete. So, this will be the last story. It won’t be forever. There is still much to tell, at least in my head. 

Thank you to everyone. I only thought that only one or two people would be interested in my silly epic. I am also glad that people are writing their own stories. Not just Danny/Tim, but so much more within that fandom. 

I may have some other ideas for fanfic. I just have limited energy and a lot of other goals to complete.
<p>
If anyone wants to know what happens to any of the characters by the end of the war, let me know.
<p>
I could listen to the rhythm of the turning wheels, but I lost my concentration. I am in a van, speeding away from Paris and from angry men with guns, where does it matter where I'm going? Louise is asleep next to me, still holding her rosary. I have nothing to stare at but her and boxes stacked in front of me. I wish Tim were here. I am hoping that he isn't being tortured. I don't want to think about if he's dead. 
<p>
I close my eyes sometimes, but I had been awake too long to sleep deeply. My eyes burn too much to stay open, so I close them for a while, still hearing the turning wheels and the sound of boxes shifting. If I could reach my compass, I'd know which direction I'm going. Then again, I can feel forces pulling me to the back of the truck. This means we are driving up. It may mean we are driving north. North to where? How long have they been driving? Are we being driven to the Forbidden Zone, that borderland with Belgium, international waters, and German installments? Why are they taking us? Are we being led into prison? Then, I decide, I will fight. 
<p>
The truck stops and Louise lurches awake. The man opens the door and motions us out. It is dawn, a fuzzy blue before the sun rises, and the wind is strong and cold. I pull my coat close and follow the man. Louise, covered in less, follows me. 
<p>
<i>An intelligence brief on Timotheé reads: "This is what is known about Timothy Burton, W's son. He was born in Lancashire. His mother is Bernadette Lavigne, a woman W met on a business trip to Lyons. Her mother Augustine-Marie, disapproved of the match. It wasn't so much that the husband was English but had no interest in art.
<p>
Bernadette had been a moody and sensitive woman, but these traits were exacerbated when Timothy went to school. She stayed indoors and used the various hidden rooms in their country rooms. W, in turn, commissioned new rooms to thwart imagined enemies. 
<p>
At age 12, Timothy developed respiratory problems and was sent to France for the climate. He as also a 'problem' in the public school his father chose for him. Augustine took care of her young grandson and enrolled him in the local lyceé. He won no awards in English public schools, and that didn't change much in France. However, he distinguished himself by his artistic gifts, winning several prizes in illustration and sculpture. He did pull up his grades enough to qualify for ENCAD, however, where he focused on illustration. 
<p>
He was also a set designer with a peculiar theater troupe specializing in elaborate costumes and satirical and carnal material. Timothy became close friends with Daniel, a young German-Jewish music director. The troupe broke up. They were recruited by SOE for rescue, sabotage and espionage. Like most small groups, however, they were betrayed by one of their own. They immediately split up. Daniel is sent to Lilles for assignment. All 
other members are unknown.
<p>
Timothy and his father have not spoken to each other since he entered ENCAD. What he knows of his father--his politics and current activities--is unknown. What his father knows of Timothy--his politics and current activities--is unknown."</i>
<p>
Dawn streaks light against the sky. The driver, Louise and I duck into alleys whenever we can, and run across empty spaces as quickly as we can. I try to take a good look at this new city, but all I see is hastily built gray apartments and the alleys between those buildings. Well, I'm not here to play tourist.
<p>
The driver pulls Louise and me toward what looked like a raised platform. The driver knocks on it, and I hear the keys jangling faintly. The platform turns out to be a door opening to a flight of stairs going down. The driver motions us to follow. Louise and I do, since I know of no other way.
<p>
It is dark here, so the driver turns on the torch and sweeps it across the room. I hear some sort of insects racing away from the beam of light. "Let's go," the driver says, and walks forward. Briefly, he brings his torch to light up one odd corner. It was a table, with beakers, tin canisters, and string. I remember those items were on the work table of an explosives lab. The tins had gunpowder, the beaker was to mix combustibles and the 
strings were fuses. Is this what this strange place is? And what am I doing there?
<p>
Who answered the door, I suddenly ask myself. Then the driver shines his torch on a long and pale hand waving. I recognize it as a man's hand at least. The hand motions us to the right and we follow. The hand knocks in Morse code (and I forgot most of it, just remember the rhythm) and opens it.
<p>
The room we go into is lit by several small candles on a large table. On that same table, as far from the candles as possible, is a radio with earphones and a cover resembling a bread box. There's paper leaves near the table's feet. On a small desk, there is a typewriter with more paper around it.
<p>
I can see the man with the pale hand at least. His black pants are dusty, maybe from the cellar. His shirt may have been white once, but now it's gray. I certainly understand; soap is at a premium these days. He is wearing boots had small holes in them, but I can see some gray wool socks under them. 
<p>
I'm startled when I see his face; I've seen those thick glasses with black frames and shaggy dark hair. He blinks and murmurs, "Daniel?"
<p>
I cock my head and reply, "Mattheus?"
<p>
"The fuck you're doing here?"
<p>
"I was going to ask you the same thing. Last time I saw you, you had just graduated."
<p>
"Well, we both know why we weren't there anymore?"
<p>
The driver looks at the both of us. "You already know each other?"
<p>
Mattheus shrugs and says, "It was a long time ago."
<p>
Mattheus lived next door to us in Berlin. While he won prizes for his writing, he drifted into studying engineering, because that was what his father did and Mattheus knew of no other thing to do. He wasn't entirely undirected. He was also a stagehand for the local amateur theater and wrote some articles for small newspapers.
<p>
Now he is in the cellar of some shitty French industrial city, and I have no idea why.
<p>
He directs us in, shoos the driver out, and closes the door. "I'm sorry I don't have any chairs, I keep my stuff to the barest minimum."
<p>
I nod and sit on the floor. What the hell? It isn't like my pants aren't dirty already. Louise squats on the floor, holding her skirt above the ground. 
<p>
"Oh," I exclaim, "I forgot to introduce you to her. Mattheus, this is Louise." 
<p>
The two clasp hands for a moment. Mattheus says "How do you do, ma'am," with a faint smile and a quick nod. Louise nods and smiles softly. Their hands hold longer than acquaintances usually do.
<p>
I get the rest of Mattheus' story with some difficulty: he often makes mistakes in French, and for some phrases, all he really knew is the German idiom. I had to correct him on some and translate for Louise on others. I will say he learns quickly.
<p>
Mattheus graduated from a different gymnasium, but he also left Berlin soon after. Engineering schools no longer admitted Jewish students, and his one prospect was a school in French city.
<p>
"What was it called," I ask.
<p>
"I don't remember," Mattheus says, "but there were lots of fucking farms on the city limits."
<p>
So, Mattheus studied engineering, struggled with his French, got better at that and graduated. Two years into his position as a tester at a radio factory, war breaks out. Radios are banned, the banning of Jews begins and Mattheus is out of the job. 
<p>
"So, I went into being a stagehand again."
<p>
"Really?"
<p>
"There was this somewhat silly group, they modeled themselves after some troupe in Paris, les Clowns de la Mort or whatever the hell they were called . . ."
<p>
Louise jumps up, almost knocking herself on the ground. "Oh! We were that!"
<p>
Mattheus looks at her and blinks. "Really?"
<p>
"And so was Daniel. He led us."
<p>
Mattheus stared at me with his eyebrows high and his eyes bulging with shock. "You?" 
<p>
I shrug. "Yeah, it was a long time ago. We've since broken up." It suddenly occurred to me that I haven't written a song, or even played a song, since last year. My fingers almost ache for a violin. But I have no time for that now.
<p>
"Yeah, well, I got involved when I could be in fewer and fewer jobs. Plus, the round-ups scared me, never mind I would be first on their list for being German and Jewish. So, I dropped out."
<p>
He leans against the wall, chuckling. "Little quiet Daniel, cabaret player and explosives fellow. I’m surprised. All I knew was this agent--from some organization, British maybe--said that there was a man who did explosives but whose group broke up and was looking for somewhere else to hide. I take it's you?"
<p>
"Well, I launched a few." Perhaps that was an understatement.
<p>
"Fair enough. How good are you at making them?"
<p>
"We always had explosives as our supplies-grenades, dynamite, sometimes plastic explosives for the metal instr-I mean, jobs." I realized that Mattheus didn't know the code. I guess it died when the group died. 
<p>
"Yeah, but agents get captured, and it is always good to have a backup."
<p>
"I can learn." 
<p>
"That's why I got this setup in someone else's basement."
<p>
I felt a twinge of guilt. What about the refugees? What about the round-ups? If they are happening in Paris, they are happening here, and I can't go back to Paris. But that is the thing: I can't go back. If I leave here out of some notion to save people, where will I go? What about Louise? I am not ready to sacrifice myself, not without a plan. 
<p>
Making explosives for another Resistance group is a good a plan as any. A hopeful whisper in my head says that I should keep alive as long as possible; Tim may still be alive. I manage to ignore the voice and turn to Mattheus.
<p>
"So else is in on this?"
<p>
Mattheus shrugs. "I know there are other cells, but I'm not allowed contact with them, unless necessary. Because, well, you know, someone always has an uncle." I knew enough that 'uncle' means 'informer.' I nod, adjusting my legs so they don't fall asleep.
<p>
My boot lands on a piece of paper. I take the paper out from under the boot and look at it. It is a poem, I guess. It concerned a German general afraid to shit in front of the French because it would disgrace the Reich. The rest of it details his trials of finding a bathroom, then shitting all over himself during a parade. Crude and stupid, but I giggle at the image.
<p>
Standing up, Mattheus gives me a run-down of the place. There was the lab over there. He is not to be disturbed while typing his broadsides. There is a bucket over there if I need to piss. Louise is to meet up with people on an arranged signal and scout. I am to make bombs. Food will be brought to Mattheus and me, but not much. Rations are tightened for the winter and the black market is getting dearer. 
<p>
I want to do my best in making the explosives. I have no other place to go, and Tim is still not here. If I keep my mind on explosives, I won't go crazy over him being missing. 
<p>
Really, there is nothing more I can do.
<p>
The first few days, I would check the door to see that it was unlocked. I never feel well enough to concentrate unless I know that I can get out of the cellar. I’d never know when I would eat. I would get turnips and black bread, and I’d greet it like manna and quail.
<p>
Perhaps out of caution, I started making low-level explosives. What can the little petrol we have be mixed with to make a decent Molotov cocktail? What can I mix with black powder to make a pipe bomb? Over time, when more supplies were smuggled in, I experimented with high explosives.
<p>
I used the boxes to test detonation velocity. I could do it in the cellar proper, but we have printing equipment, not just me, to worry about. When the box stays intact, I go back to the lab. If the bomb is too weak in the box, imagine what it will be like in the factory. Sometimes the smoke and damage in the box give me an idea of the charge diameter. Also I have to take into account the high confinement and overestimate the ingredients. Also, making the explosive heavier will damage more, so when I get a compound, I try to pack in more of it. I cannot make TNT or anything like that, but I could make composites. Some of the material is smuggled from factories and some are improvised from what is around here.
<p>
Sometimes I soaked cotton wool in with gelatinized cellulose for guncotton. It is somewhat a misnomer, since it is too powerful for gun barrels, but I was smuggled ether, alcohol and nitric and sulphuric acid. On occasion, they find materials for glycerin. A few times, I use soaps for the base. Thank God they also smuggled rubber gloves. Someone suggested wearing cotton wrap for extra protection, so I have a pair of old ladies' gloves under the rubber gloves for protection. Don't tell anyone.
<p>
At first, it's easy to think of nothing but the composite. I have to make so many measurements and I have so little room for error, that the task consumes all of my attention. At night, I'm constantly on guard for any sign someone is coming to the basement. All this almost pushes Tim out of my mind, just like when I was working as a dishwasher.
<p>
Then I start to have headaches. Often, I stop what I am doing and close my eyes because the pain is so bad. One time, I had to run out and vomit. I wish Johann was here, I think in between heaves, he'd know what was wrong.
<p>
A visitor picking up his 'package' finally told me what was wrong: exposure to nitroglycerin causes headaches. Since the last few days, however, I have fewer headaches. The ones I have aren't so bad that I have to stop work. Perhaps this is a good thing. 
<p>
Louise visits me sometimes, after long days of scouting and cajoling. She shivers in the cold cellar. I am glad she visits, not just because she reminds me that the cellar has a door and I won’t be locked in like the last time. 
<p>
We talk about Tim when we are together. We remember him talking with gestures, remember him drawing and remember him and his shy touches when we had him alone. He seemed both unaware and very aware of how he seduces people. Sometimes I want contact so much, that I let Louise give me a hand job while thinking of Tim. In return, I let her rub against my thigh, letting her relieved herself. It didn’t feel like cheating; I didn’t mind when Tim fooled around with her. Besides, it helps me concentrate on explosives.
<p>
She is the only one I talk to about Tim. I am often alone, and when the other members come to pick up the explosives, we talk about horses and gossip about battles, the Americans, speculations of an invasion of France and comparing racetrack horses. I don’t tell them; he stays in my heart.
<p>
I am not always alone. Mattheus comes in to type newspapers. When Louise comes in, his normal apathy disappears. Instead, when she comes into the cellar, he follows her around with dreamy eyes. He makes halting conversation about Louise’s past acting roles. They would talk about the plays Mattheus helped with and the play Louise still wants to finish. Maybe behind her bland smile, she is scrutinizing Mattheus-or maybe she is just talking. I have no clue, and I can see Mattheus trying to find some affection from her. Yet, when I am in the room, he looks at me too, trying to figure out if I am angry with him. His conversations with her are shorter, and he glances at me ever so often. I glance at him, and he is relieved when I ignore him and make bombs. 
<p>
One day, we're alone: I have just finished making some guncotton and he's typing away.
<p>
"Mattheus? May I talk to you?"
<p>
He looks up and stiffens. "Yes?"
<p>
"It's about Louise."
<p>
He leans toward me and stays stiffly in his seat. "Listen, I am not sure if she is with you or not . . ."
<p>
"She is not with me."
<p>
"What?"
<p>
"Louise is a friend, nothing more. If she wants to be with you, I won't stop you."
<p>
Mattheus blinks through his thick glasses. "Are you joking?"
<p>
"I'm quite sincere. She is free to do what she wishes."
<p>
Mattheus nods, but looks at me again. "I don’t understand it."
<p>
"What?"
<p>
"Why would you not want someone as beautiful and kind as she is?"
<p>
I shrug. "I have another, and I want to be faithful. Maybe I'm asking the impossible from myself." I may fool around with her, but I am not going to throw Tim over for her yet. Not until I know what happened to him.
<p>
"She must be wonderful."
<p>
I don’t bother to correct him. It is too much work. It is too much to risk. I shake my head and say, "I have to get back to work."
<p>
I learn not just from whatever mistakes I made but from what happened when others used them. This one took too long to detonate. This one produced too much smoke, making it too easy to draw attention. This one is too sensitive to shock. This one is too insensitive. I took note of insufficient confinement, what metals produce the most friction, and what to make in places with high water pressure.
<p>
However, part of me wants to be out there. Part of me wants to detonate the explosives rather than just stand here. 
<p>
After my conversation with Mattheus, Louise comes into the cellar one day. He gives her a piece of paper. She reads it and gives Mattheus a big hug. Mattheus laughs nervously and says "I'm glad you liked my poem." After that, though, they go on their separate tasks. 
<p>
Grisett met a sad end one day. I had given some explosives one day, when I see that Grisett was not in his hutch. We find out one of the saboteurs stole Grisett and killed it for their lunch. I am not sure what to say. I can understand hunger, but Grisett was not good eating. When Louise found out, she cried for days. Mattheus would sit by her while she mourned for her rabbit, but he couldn’t say anything to the saboteurs. We are, in essence, working for them.
<p>
Louise is spending more time with Mattheus, even sleeping with him in the basement. They look so happy snuggling together, and I am happy for them. I suppose. However, I have no one to talk to at night. I don't mind the sleeping alone, it's the dealing with the dreams that sadden me. In dreams, I also seem to be searching for Tim. Sometimes I find him, but it all fades before I find out what happened to him. 
<p>
Not that I don't talk to Mattheus, though. 
<p>
"You know what I did before I got here?"
<p>
"What?"
<p>
"Help people get out of France. I should be doing that, not just staying in the basement with all these chemicals."
<p>
"Think of it this way: you are helping to slow down manufacturing. Less material means that we may end the war sooner."
<p>
"I suppose."
<p>
Our tenure in the basement ends when we hear of saboteur arrests. Not wanting to wait around until we are raided, we pack up the printing press and lab equipment in suitcases. The chemicals I put in tins and close tight. Shoeless, we sneak out in the dead of night. I don't know where we are going. Then again, when is that new?
<p>
Not all of the people we’re working with were captured. Couple of them pointed us to another basement. The apartment proper was close to a major mechanics plants. The person who owns the apartment tells us of orders to destroy major parts of that same plant. The way he sees it, it will keep the Allies from using bombers. The last thing he wants is the whole town angry because of misplaced bombs on apartment buildings. 
<p>
Louise and I are the only ones who are not spotted yet, so we volunteer. The next few days, we develop a rhythm. Louise sometimes flirts with factory workers or gets information from former factory employees. She returns and funnels it to Mattheus. Mattheus draws the maps then shows it to me. I keep on making and testing explosives. I do not get as much feedback as I did in the old location, but I am confident I learned enough. The prospect of taking one factory by my hands elated me, I admit. It makes it easy to wait for Tim.
<p>
<i>"Well, now, first, why am I here?"
<p>
"Your father has been involved in certain . . . activities since you left England, Timotheé ."
<p>
"He is reported to have strange guests coming from Sweden. We caught one, attempting to cut cable wires . . ."
<p>
"A saboteur? And a rotten one at that?"
<p>
"Well, yes. He claimed your father was harboring more."
<p>
"So, why didn't you get him?"
<p>
"The house he is harboring them, from what we gathered from former employees, had many hidden rooms and trapped doors . . ."
<p>
"He's still there?"
<p>
"He lived there when you were in England."
<p>
"Well, yeah, and you never really knew where he was, there would be, you know, all these bells to ring and dumb waiters, and dead ends and . . ."
<p>
"So, you would know how to get there."
<p>
"He'd always hide in this one room."
<p>
"You know how to get there?"
<p>
"I don't know, I haven't been there since I was twelve. Why not one of the former servants?"
<p>
"Because they do not know where the one room is, Mr. Burton."
<p>
"Tim."
<p>
"Right."
<p>
"I got two things to ask before--"
<p>
"You are not in a position to ask."
<p>
"Hear me out, dammit. I can easily say no."
<p>
"You'll go to jail."
<p>
"Yeah, but at least here I won't die. Now--two things. What happens to the house if, you know, my dad did these things?"
<p>
"Well, Mr. Bur--Tim--it gets reverted to the Crown, that is, if your father is guilty of treason." 
<p>
"All right. All right, yeah, I got two things to ask you if you want my help." 
<p>
"I'm listening." 
<p>
"One: use the house for refugees. You don't know what is happening in France, in other places too. The Nazis are sending people to their death." 
<p>
"We know of the arrest and execution of leftists and the mass execution of civilians by the government after a Resistance action. . ." 
<p>
"No, no, these people aren't in any movement. They are just going on with their lives. They-they-it's Gypsies, it's the Jews. They are being killed just for that. I want to, you know, have them have some place to go. Some place safe." 
<p>
The interrogator laughs. "My father tells stories of the tinkers, they fix your pots and steal your money. Jews-well, I can understand some sympathy from you. It may be a hard thing to sell to others, however. But really, anyway, I'm sure the Gypsies . . ." 
<p>
"They need a place. You don't know. I've heard it from people who don't lie. I've seen them chase after people who never did a thing to them. I'm not helping if I don't get it." 
<p>
"You could be arrested for treason." 
<p>
"And you know I am not fucking guilty. I will be in prison, and my father still won't be stopped. Our countries are both in danger if he keeps harboring saboteurs, spies, whatever."
<p>
"All right. We will need the house for a few months--repairs really--then we ask that you be given the deed. I promise you nothing beyond that." 
<p>
"Right. One more thing to ask?" 
<p>
"Yes?" "I want to go back to France to get things together." 
<p>
"What things? God, you said you'd die if you go back."
<p>
"I know, but there are people I need to say goodbye to. Or bury. Whatever." 
<p>
"We will see if there are Lysanders on the route you want to go. All of these are on the condition you help us get into the house and find your father." 
<p>
"Sure. I have to warn you: I haven't been there since I was twelve. I am only going by what rooms were there when I was twelve." 
<p>
"It is better than knowing nothing."
</i>
<p>
We debate bombing the factory, but we figured we would be spotted. We received a shipping of plastic explosives. Can be wrapped around damn near anything and make a terrific mess of the works. Fortunately, Louise promised to ask one of her contacts to bring them in. Mattheus did take note of some train tracks going to and from the factory town. He suggests using my
explosives. Perhaps because of not wanting to use other people's work when I worked so hard on my explosives, I agreed. 
<p>
We debate who will go out there. Mattheus has the radio equipment, and can contact people if any of us are in trouble. I was to set it up. Louise was to watch for any problems and report to Mattheus. She can blend in with the crowd better than I ever could. 
<p>
We decided on twilight in two days. It will give me enough light to work, few trains passed after final bell, we can make it back before curfew, and we can hide better after the work is done. Louise finds a changing stall.
<p>
"Stay away from the door until I'm finished. Who knows what could fly at us?"
<p>
She nods and closes the door. 
<p>
I didn't make plastic explosives, just some a box with some nitroglycerine and a long fuse. I grab a matchbook I had from my pocket and light the fuse. Or rather, I wave the match at the fuse then run like hell. Fortunately, the flame took. I could see Louise peeking through a changing stall. I hop over the fence and duck to watch. 
<p>
When I see the explosion, I run more, finding a place where debris won't hit. The explosive noise seems to fill the entire field. Someone will hear it real soon. I could see bigger chunks than I thought were possible. I made a stronger batch with a bigger explosive velocity than I thought. I was about to go further when I see a large piece of debris, heading right for the changing stall. I lurch from a debris hitting the fence, trying not to panic. Oh God, Louise in there, if she just stays in, she might stay alive. The 
problem may be grabbing her out of rubble. 
<p>
The debris stops falling and I can hear the first of witnesses. Fuck, I've got to get her out of there. If she's injured, she can be brought in by the gendarmerie, and they'll give her over to the Gestapo just for being at a sabotaged site. I run as fast as I can and hops the fence, hoping we are not spotted yet.
<p>
I stop thinking of running when I see the damage. The door should have buckled under the debris, but it is intact, albeit off the hinges. No, I see the buckled changing stall that Louise is draped over. Debris pins her there. Blood trickles out of the mouth, her skin is the pale of the dead rather than the isolated, and her eyes are open and glassy. If I look closer, I can see blood pooling on her stomach. I check her pulse, out of some insane 
hope that she is just hurt. Nothing.
<p>
She opened the door. She fucking opened the door!
<p>
The shouting gets louder. I have nothing else to do. I close her eyelids and take off my shoes. I could only run without shoes and without Louise. When I make it to the basement, I realize how much I was shaking.
<p>
I tell Mattheus everything. I expected him to hate him; we haven't seen each other since we were seventeen, and here I go and she dies because I made the fucking mixture too strong.
<p>
But she opened the door, I remember. An equation of my miscalculation plus her miscalculation equals her death and my grief. 
<p>
Mattheus slumps. He is quiet and leans his forehead against his hands. I cannot think of anything to say; I know the standard clichés of mourners and offers of food. However, there are rations and noise to think about.
<p>
Then Mattheus speaks. "I survived so far, and, call me superstitious, but I know why. Every place I sabotage, I save at least one person from dying in a RAF raid, or being shot by a firing squad . . ."
<p>
I add without thinking, "Or herded up in the camps?" 
<p>
He nods, maybe not wanting to believe me. "Every person I save adds one more year to my life."
<p>
"Do you really believe that?" Much has happened in seven years, but I never expected to hear that talk from him.
<p>
"I don't know what to believe." Mattheus' voice is now muffled, his head into his folded arms. "I just wish . . . I just wish I could give one year of my life to bring Louise back."
<p>
Nothing I can say can pull him out. On the other hand, he doesn't hate me. It must be something.
<p>
I look over the corner, and see Louise's suitcase. She always carried that thing. I never really asked what was in it. I realize I should have asked. 
<p>
I open it, expecting frilly things from before the war or maybe that play she was writing, whatever highly emotional actresses bring with them. 
<p>
I see envelopes, only envelopes. They are cream-colored and expensive-looking, but never opened. Maybe she had a rich lover she was sentimental over. I bring it closer and notice who it is addressed to. Who the fuck is "Mr. Timothy Burton," anyway?
<p>
Then I remember what Tim told me in the washroom of the Grand Guignol a long time ago. He changed his surname to his grandmother's name. It is easy enough to see that 'Timothy' is another form of 'Timotheé ,' but the last name is not French. Judging from the return address, these are from England. I flip through them, and see they have the postal markers from 1933 to 1939. In the left corner, there is a name. "W. Burton."
<p>
Who is he and how does Tim know him? Is this the father he hates so much? I will have to read them. Maybe I can figure from the past scribbles where he is. If he is angry about it, well, I was only trying to help.
<p>
I look at the suitcases again the night I am assigned to watch the basement. Mattheus told me he was visiting a friend. I cannot tell what he really means; I'll know when he comes.
<p>
I open the suitcase again. Why was Louise carrying these unopened letters? Who was the man writing to Tim? Burton? I never heard that surname before.
<p>
So, all these letters addressed to Tim (at his grandmother's apartment, I noticed) by a person in England. The letter writer addresses them to 'Timothy Burton.' Perhaps this is the name he had before he took his
grandmother's name. 
<p>
I want to open the letters and find the answers. Isn't that rude? Opening another person's mail--that's spying. What of it? Everyone is spying on each other. Gestapo is spying on every French person who’s not an informer. Everyone else is spying to protect themselves.
<p>
I'm not spying on Tim. He's missing, but I trust him. He's the one person I trust completely. At very least, Tim knows everything about my life. Even Mattheus doesn't know the whole details of affairs gone sour. He doesn't know about Tim.
<p>
On the other hand, there is a paper heater where I'm sleeping. It is the only source of heat here. If I don't get more paper, it will get chilly. I can use the envelopes and then the letters. If Tim asks, I will tell him about feeding the paper heater.
<p>
That is, if he hasn't turned traitor.
<p>
I open the first few envelopes with my fingers. However, after the first paper cut, I stop. After sucking on my finger, I search around for a makeshift letter opener. I see a knife on my lab table. I use it to cut glycerin. It is clean now, so I can use it as a letter opener. I grab it and open the rest of the letters.
<p>
In a half an hour, I open all the letters. I tear the first envelope to feed the heater. It is enough for now. Now I have the first letter in my hand. If I trusted him, I would tear this letter too. I read it, though. I want to know about this part of Tim's life he never talks about. 
<p>
I read the first letter, feeling secure that I know enough English to
understand it:
<p>
<i>10-October-1934
<p>
To Timothy:
<p>
I trust that you are well and starting school. Your grandmother wrote me that you're getting color and breathing easier. As you have reached your twelfth year, I feel I can be candid with you, as I could not when your mother was alive. Her sympathy turns from a virtue to a vice when it came to your upbringing. A gentlemen must be a man of action as well as erudition. Perhaps her Gallic nature made it hard to comprehend. Her beauty blinded me, but after her passing (and her terrible fevers and moods), I understand 
it better. 
<p>
The construction of house is going well. When you visit during Christmas, there will be many private rooms so you can do your schoolwork. I trust that you won't stay in too long with your drawing. It would do well for you to go outside, ride horses and hunt. Perhaps we can talk about the 
intricacies of investment. I advise for your future career.
<p>
I have had a delicious dinner: pot roast, new potatoes, leek soup (perhaps your mother's tastes have rubbed off on me), carrots, and my favorite, butterscotch pudding. 
<p>
Despite the lag 'between the wars,' there are people starting businesses and people who can give them capital. I do well whatever the state of the pound. I have begun tracking foreign currency and even have taken to collecting some. Not bad for a son of a greengrocer. 
<p>
I have attended meetings with Sir Mosley and other such gentlemen in the Union of British Fascists. I feel like I can see after years of blindness. Young man, you do not often hear of the treacherous Jews that control the financial establishments of England and other nations. The newspapers are bought out by them, but no matter, truth will out. They are the enemies of all mankind and wish to break 
every nation. I have enclosed literature that explains it better than a 
simple banker ever could. 
<p>
It illuminated a situation that troubled me. I worked very hard, and yet I am not president. Few people in my work will defer to me as they should. Perhaps some rude and common Hebrews with illegal nose jobs and assumed names are in my bank. They have some grudge against a born and bred Englishman. Their time will come, I assure you. The Deutschmark has been solid and German businesses are profiting ever since they got rid of their Jews. I think that is no coincidence. I can happily see that happening 
for England, to correct Cromwell's mistake. It will be better for all the world if the Jews were brought down low and be a lost and hated race in history.
<p>
You should beware. They are in France too. Your grandmother scoffs, but she falls for anyone with a clever line and artistic pretensions. They have that, but nothing more. I must cut this off, since I am tired and have a long day at the investment house. I feel since that you are a man, I can appeal to your reason. You are my son, even if you are the son of a hysteric. You must have some capacity to observe facts and come to the same conclusion I have. I leave you the pamphlet and to your introspection. 
<p>
Farewell,<br>
Daddy
</i>
<p>
I found a pamphlet with that letter. Crude paper, ink that smeared, and an oh-so-realistic picture of some oily man with a hooked nose. "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"--I've seen those pamphlets in French too. Yeah, I am here in the basement, freezing my ass, half-asleep and half-anxious, in a bid to take over the world. I don't even want the world. I just want some corner of it, where I can be with my friends and write music again. I want Tim in that corner of the world. Could the Elders arrange that for me? 
<p>
I skimmed the rest of the letters, trying to see if there are hints of Tim being somewhere else. No, it was the same thing: why aren't you writing back to me, the Jews are out to get me, the Jews are destroying world, Mosley, not taking the uniform just yet, Deutschmarks. You would think that there were more Jews in England than all of Europe, and were all bent on destroying the life of Timothy's father. I know this is his father; he mentions it more than once, in some attempt to get him to write back. Sometimes he complains that Timotheé hasn't talked to him since his mother died. 
<p>
He has no idea about Tim's life. He doesn't know of ENCAD or Louise, I see no mention of his set design, nothing. How can he, he is too busy examining the noses of his fellow bankers? Then I laugh. He doesn't know that Tim is fucking a Jew. I almost want to write back to Monsieur Burton: "Hello, I am your son's male Jewish lover. I am a damn good one if your son's screaming is any proof." 
<p>
I remember Isolde and her capitulation to her parents' prejudices, even if she had no problem with circumcised dick. Instead, Timotheé  went underground and left school to be with me. Why me? Why this? How could he throw off his father's paranoia?
<p>
Why didn't Tim tell me about his father? I remember anger, but nothing more. Perhaps hearing his 'sympathy' disparaged was enough to alienate him. I just wish the letters would give more of Timotheé 's fate and less of his father's rants.
<p>
I did find other things folded in with the letters. There were Deutschmarks, about five hundred in all. There are none in the letters after 1939, after Poland was invaded, but there was enough. 
<p>
I look at the paper lantern, and see it is running low. I tear a corner of the pamphlet and then feel guilty. I remember the book burnings before I escaped Germany. Surrealists and realists, people with the wrong sort of politics and people with the wrong sort of ancestors, constrained to the bonfire. What makes what I am doing different than what they did? Then again, I am ripping envelopes-the pamphlet is a piece of paper, much like the envelopes. Why not put that piece of shit to good use? So I tear the pamphlet in two, fours, and then eights. I put the Deutschmarks in one envelope and promise myself I will hide it in my duffel bag. Really, the currency is less stable than it was when Monsieur Burton was writing, 
but what of it? A black marketer must accept it somewhere. I feed the pamphlet to the fire. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long. Damn cheap paper. I rip up the letters, and wonder how I will explain this to Tim. He should understand. 
<p>
Mattheus came back and sees me with shredded paper in my minds. "So, what were they?"
<p>
"Dead letters. Who knows why she kept them? I made them fuel for the lantern."
<p>
He nods and rubs his eyes. "Tomorrow, you will go scouting."
<p>
I nod. I don't ask what he found out. I go into my corner and catch a few hours of sleep.
<p>
We get up and I start walking toward the chemistry lab. Just then, a man walks in the door with a gun. Several men followed him. Oh, shit, someone informed the Gestapo. Which poor saboteur squealed? Whatever, I draw my piece, kept in my pants' waistband. Mattheus runs to his blanket. Just as he is going to get grabbed, he pulls out a Tommy gun. Some of them go down, but someone has a submachine gun. I duck near the table and keep shooting. Mattheus falls dead from a hail of bullets and I try not to look down. 
<p>
They come closer, and I keep shooting. That is when I realize I am down to one bullet. I reach into my pocket, hoping to find ammo. I just find matches. I look right next to me, and there's an explosive in an old and small plum crate. I grab that, light it and run toward the radio room. If I close the door fast enough, I can get them all and protect the expensive and illegal radio and mimeograph. 
<p>
I didn't close it fast enough. My shirt caught on fire. I use my last ounce of strength to close the door and roll away in case of more fire. Dropping and rolling, well, I burned then I was scratched by the floors. Maybe I got splinters in there. I wait for the door to open, wait to find the bomb didn't get all of them. I fully expect to use that last bullet to shoot myself, just like Vatos. 
<p>
For a few minutes, there was nothing. I open the door and am thrown back by the smell of smoke and burned flesh. If they aren't here, they escaped and calling reinforcements. I have to get out. 
<p>
Before I could talk myself out of it, I grab one agent's great coat and then his shirt. I take off his hat and see it: red hair. Mind, it is sandy rather than red. I am sure all the poor bastard squealed was that I had red hair. I just hope he didn't say how red. I put my shirt on him and his hat on me. 
<p>
I do one last thing before I leave. I pack up the radio and the mimeograph, and hide them into suitcases. I carry them with me, and try not to think how heavy they are or my back hurting. I look at my old chemistry table, but enough of the equipment burned away. It is combustible enough. 
<p>
Jeeps are racing to the house. I nod and walk. I keep walking until I am out of the city limits. I had no idea where to stop. I keep walking, and rip off the coat insignia and the armband as I walk.
<p>

<p>
- Richard Huelsenbeck, in the Dada Almanach (1920).</b>
<p>
Three narrow escapes. Here I am walking in a Gestapo overcoat, with a pistol and some money I swiped from letters. I lost my false papers. I don't even know if I did grab his papers. If I saw me, I'd shoot me.
<p>
I don't take it off, though. It is for one a very cold day (is it February or March? I haven't seen a calendar in a while). Two, if I don't have it, people will assume that I am a labor resister or a criminal. I could be sheltered, or I could be arrested. I could be sent to a labor camp. If they catch on to me being Jewish, well, I am done for.
<p>
I keep to the dirt roads and the forest, hoping that no one gets off the main roads. Night comes, and I can feel the legs becoming sore. Yet, I am not sure I can sleep anywhere. I don't know where the safe houses are around here, the great coat and money will look very suspicious, and I have nothing to show I am not a mole.
<p>
I see something narrow and square in the distance. I walk by force of will, looking around me. It has a roof. I pull at the door handle and almost tumble back when the door opens.
<p>
Even in the dark, the white walls glow. Niches are on the walls, from top to bottom. What kind of place is this?
<p>
Then I look closer and see white and gray feathers and well, white and gray shit. This was a pigeon coop. Carrier pigeons were probably banned, and now this coop is empty.
<p>
It doesn't matter. It is quiet, and even if it is cold now, it won't get colder. I sit down, taking care not to get near the pigeon shit.
<p>
I'm tired, but once again, I cannot sleep. I hear the wind through budding trees and my breathing, but I am waiting for footsteps.
<p>
I rummage in my pocket for food, and find a curled and yellowed photograph. It was all of us, posed, maybe for a poster. How I still had that photograph, I cannot remember. Johann has his red and blue wooden balls used in his juggling act. Helene manages to bring in her cello. Christine and Stefan have their guitars, Tatiana and Avila violin, Tim a sketch pad, Louise-Marguerite a flute, Marie-Pascale a clarinet, Miriam with her trumpet, Vatos with his top hat and drum sticks, Dexter a trumpet, Jane a French horn, Sluggo saxophone and Michel and Richard their accordians. We and our rag-tag orchestra. Now, I'm wondering if I am the only one left.
<p>
I hum in the pigeon coop a song I wrote a long time ago.
<p>
<i>"Je danse heureusement<br>
La Mort coupes, coupes, coupes<br>
Mais il ne m'attrapera pas."<p>
</i>
I'm hiding from death, but it is only a matter of time.
<p>
Somewhere between the cold and the hunger, I remember my violin. Somewhere after we rescued Christine, Bartek and Avila, I just didn't write any more music. The busking effectively ended, and really, music means noise, which means attention, which means police, and that means jail. I left the violin and all the music I wrote in Paris. I could do with something to do with my hands, at least. Fuck it if anyone hears me; it will just hasten the death that is coming. 
<p>
Now I just hide and remember that Tim liked to hear me practice. He once asked me to play on a piano his grandmother owned. I had this long explanation about how long it's been since I've played, but he wasn't listening.
<p>
"Yes, yes, fine, I know. I know! Just--Hit the key! Hit the key! Which one!" The poor bastard was pounding on different keys, his dark hair flopping around in frustration. I had to grab his shoulders to still him, but I couldn't stop laughing.
<p>
He squinted at me. "What in the name of Jesus," he started to say when I kissed him.
<p>
I giggled before I finally said, "I'll play." I thought I played horribly, but he had a small smile and clapped loudly for an encore. I politely refused, but liked it a lot more than I should. When he was happy, the joy flooded the room. When he was sad, he would never let anyone see--just me and Louise.
<p>
I left the music behind. How funny. When I broke up the group and left Timotheé  the first time, I couldn't stop writing music. Now? If I had an instrument, would I really play anything other than scales?
<p>
I want to think something else other than him. If he was captured, if they did get information, they may send him back to lure the others out. Oh God, and he might not want to . Does he really think the things his father wrote? He couldn't. He wouldn't do what he did if he did. He wouldn't be with me at all.
<p>
He loves me. I love him. I never told him that. And the next time I see him, I may have to kill him to protect the others, to protect myself. Please, let him be safe.
<p>
I am in the same place I was when the Nazis marched into Paris. I feel trapped, alone and don’t know what to do next or where to go. Wait, there was a difference. I had my family and friends. I had Tim, who wasn’t family and who was more than a friend. Now, my family is in another country, my friends are gone and Tim is gone, and I don’t know where or why.
<p>
I debate with myself. What if he is never coming back? What if he broke and they are coming for me? Does he hold his father’s beliefs? He must have learned them, but how come he never seemed to take them? Is this all a ruse, like Tatiana? He has said nothing to make me suspicious. He has been sincere and trustworthy, even too trusting of me? What if I am doomed that way? What if he really believed it when someone said I wouldn’t get hurt if he just tells them where we are? I have no reason to think ill of him, but it seems that I have no way of knowing if people can still be trusted. 
<p>
My eyes hurt too much to keep them open, but I do not eat the ‘slice of death’ that is sleep. I try, and images flash. I see Tatiana’s corpse in the alleyway, Louise’s broken body, and bullets in Mattheus’ body. I’ve been seeing too much death to want the dress rehearsal. 
<p>
On a night like this, I decided that I was going to throw myself into this business, do what I could to vex the Nazis, and keep others from the camps. I found some courage, but I lost it now. I lost my friends, and connections to the outside. I was so absorbed in sabotage that I don’t know if I can find people to keep out of their way. 
<p>
I think back to what he said about what people will say, what stories they will tell. He was telling the truth, I know that much. He was not reserved, he was not stoic and stiff. That was the best part of him. That was what made me love him. We would fight because of it, but I wouldn’t change him. I sigh, and wish I had that right now. I love him, and I can’t tell him. I wish I had him. I sigh and try to sleep again. 
<p>
In another time, I would try to write a song. My violin is lost, however, and I cannot make noise. My growling stomach jolts me out of my mooning. How long has it been since I ate?
<p>
I hear mud smooshing outside the coop. Well, shit, I better not make any noise. I wait for the smooshing to fade, trying not to breath loud enough for them to hear me. I grab my pistol and walk out the coop. I pray no one turns around. 
<p>
All I see is a black greatcoat and close-cropped dark hair. I debate with myself: rob him, follow him, or talk to him? I spot a duffel bag close to a tree with budding leaves. I run behind that tree, hearing mud under my shoes (and getting in and on my shoes). I am behind that tree before the man turns around. He looks up, confused and walks away. 
<p>
I don't know if this gamble was worth it. Maybe he was Milicene or Gestapo or some other 'law' enforcement and I should have shot him. After so much death, I don't really have the stomach for 'playing out.' The time for killing will be soon enough.
<p>
I search through the bag. I find a notebook and a round ball of cloth. I open up the cloth. It's cheese, cured meat, and bread. Food! But wait, is this a trap? No one could leave a duffel bag out in the woods. I open the notebook, hoping for clues. "Nicholas, age 6." Perhaps that is why there is a duffel bag with food. A schoolboy forgot his lunch.
<p>
The cheese is hard, but I am sure it tastes fine, and the bread does not look stale. Maybe the late evening dew kept it fresh. I stop myself from shoving it all in my mouth. I thank the boy Nicholas, wherever he is. I leave the duffel bag, wondering if I should turn it in--it must have his lessons, at least. No, the last place I need to be is at a police station. 
<p>
I nibble on the food as I walk in the woods, zigzaging deeper. I keep walking until dawn. If it was summer, I'd look for berries. This season, however, the best I can hope for wild food is shoots of grass. When Isolde and I were bored, we would pluck leaves of grass and nibble on the root. It was not filling, just a taste to wash the brandy out of our mouths. I chuckle; the bitch is part of the reason why I am thinking of eating grass. No, it's not her fault I am in France. I stayed because of Timotheé . All I can do is move on. 
<p>
In the summer, I would hike. I try to remember what I know, like following running bodies of water to civilization. I am not sure if I want to. 
<p>
I hear a car engine rumbling and being shut off. Damn it all. Away from civilization, then. Where I am, the thicket is not deep enough to hide me. I bet whoever that was can see me now. 
<p>
I run, not caring how much noise I make or where I am going, I just want to get away. I hear running behind me. Fuck, he is catching up to me.
<p>
My legs burn but I can’t be sure I’d be safe if I slow down. I gasp for breath and run faster. Never mind I ate this morning, I am not sure if I have enough energy to elude the person. I have to try. 
<p>
I stop only when my foot hit a large fallen branch. I fall, a little shocked to see my line of sight change from the trees to ground. Blurry too, since my glasses fell off. I catch my fall by putting my hands on the cold and wet ground. I find my glasses, now muddy, and put them back on. I can’t see a fucking thing, but I can feel that my foot is stuck. I yank it out, wincing from the smaller branches scrapping on my ankle. Fuck it, I have to get up and get out, now!
<p>
Someone’s hand grabs my shoulder before I could. I can’t reach for my pistol in time, so I roll around. Then I hook my leg around his and try to pull him down. Undeterred, he grabs at my wrist, He stumbles, but doesn’t fall down. 
<p>
The man yells, “You’re from that Clowns group, right?” He lifts me up by the wrist and I blink. Time to get a good look at this person and figure if he is friend or foe. 
<p>
“High Command told me you were dead,” he says in French. I recognize that thin face and narrow brown eyes and that not too short or too long light brown hair. No birthmarks, scars or blemishes. His face is so common that it seems uncommon.
<p>
“Monsieur Massion, I should have told, but I do not know the area well.” I wipe the dirt off my pants.
<p>
“So you decide to go as far from people as possible?”
<p>
“The trees seemed less likely to inform on you.”
<p>
“Yes, but you could run into some soldiers doing training exercises or some border patrol. More of them this year. Funny how as Germany loses more, they are cracking on everyone harder.”
<p>
I nod. “As I said, I don’t know the area well.” I bend down to the stream to wash the mud off my glasses. I wipe them on my shirt, put them on, and face M. Massion. “What now?”
<p>
“I got a car--managed to tell them that I am a very important financier, don’t know how. I cannot drive you far, but I can tell you where to go.”
<p>
I nod and grab M. Massion’s arm. He looks at me with a raised eyebrow. “Yes?”
<p>
“If anyone asks, I’m a plainclothes officer and you are a railway saboteur who tried to escape into the woods.” He nods and we march out of the woods. 
<p>
He gives me directions to the next safe house, which is a way through the woods, oddly enough. I listen as best as I could, but I think back to the dinner where I last saw him. Let's hope his judgment about safe houses have improved since the last time. 
<p>
"There were fourteen of us. Now three are dead, one has turned traitor, and one disappeared and I don't know where he is."
<p>
M. Massion nods. "That is why you and the girl were sent to another location."
<p>
"I know that you aren't supposed to give names, so I will try and say it. I am afraid that someone, someone I know, has been kidnapped and will betray me. If you find the rest, you have to warn them--"
<p>
"Who are you talking about?" Then he blinks. "Now I know. I remember him. I remember the hair and the gestures. That art student."
<p>
I nod. 
<p>
"I can only tell you what I was told. He is being held by us. We need information from him. He has not betrayed you, in fact, he was to be . . . consulted, yes, consulted, because he has been loyal."
<p>
I thought of his father's letter. "So you knew about his father in Prince Albert Hall?" 'Prince Albert Hall' was a code word for the United Kingdom.
<p>
"I only know that he is recalled there."
<p>
I stare at him. "Why didn't you tell us? I could have sent him--"
<p>
"We were starting to suspect the seamstress."
<p>
I blink and sigh. "I know about that too."
<p>
M. Massion laughed. "Amateurs. You were just a group of friends; you were all playing tag while they are playing chess."
<p>
"He is safe?"
<p>
"All I can say is he is safe?"
<p>
"Will he come back?"
<p>
M. Massion shakes his head. "I cannot tell you that because I do not know."
<p>
Silence, then he adds, "Besides, the High Command thought that you were too close."
<p>
I'm taken aback by M. Massion's words. I didn't say out loud we were lovers, but I made it clear we, Tim and I, were together. "Were they afraid that if Tim betrayed us, I wouldn't execute him?"
<p>
"No. They were afraid you'd execute him without proof." M. Massion closes his eyes. "They didn't want to see it, but I knew enough people like you and me to know. I knew you loved him as more than a friend. Lovers either want to believe they would never betray each other, or at the first hint they are betrayed, grieve so much they execute the beloved."
<p>
I couldn't say anything, because he's right. All this time, when he was with me, I was afraid to tell him I loved him, afraid of being broken-hearted, not dead. Now I see my actions, and I see my fears about Tim.
<p>
So, he is alive, and he hasn't betrayed me--us--but I cannot reach him. I wonder if he thinks I'm dead.
<p>
I nod and walk out of M. Massion's car. "I have to leave soon," I tell him.
<p>
M. Massion reaches in his glove compartment and gives me a case of bullets and dried fruit. "You will need these." I nod my thanks and walk away.
<p>
Now out in the field, I wish that I stayed in the car. I only know where I am going by M. Massion's directions. It is dark and cold, and I have to keep very quiet. When I hear other humans, I duck in whatever place I can find. I haven't washed in days, and I can smell sweat, dust and dirt on me. I was told once that dogs could smell fear. I am sure I reek of fear.
<p>
When I got out of the car, it is warm outside. Or, at least, warmer than it was. I set aside my dry food and consider my route.
<p>
I could take the same path I was taking, zigzagging through the woods. However, I know that somehow, some army unit will want to do training exercises, some law enforcement will be on high alert, and that most know the same know-how about woodlands you'd get from hiking. At least I have my pistol and a place to go. I just hope no one is following me. 
<p>
Birds sing over jeep engines and my foot steps. I try to hear for other footsteps. Nothing so far. The sun is out and peeks through the trees. Sometimes, I see it glint off the morning dew. Still, I keep moving. I walk fast, only stopping when I hear noises that are not birds or my footsteps. I hide behind trees and look for leaf cover. At times, I consider climbing trees, but they are just budding, and not good cover. 
<p>
<i>Tim almost stayed behind in his makeshift room at an equally makeshift headquarters. The plan was that the agents would pose as other agents, use the map, and take Tim's father into custody. Two days before, Tim asked if he can come with them.
<p>
"Good God, you could get killed."
<p>
"Maybe not. I want to see him one more time."
<p>
"It could provide a better cover. Perhaps we can come in when Timothy gives his word."
<p>
He nods. He never thought of that before. He just wanted to see his father before the arrest was official. He wanted to see if ten years changed his father. 
<p>
His chance to see came soon enough. Tim is greeted by the gardener who knew Tim as a child. The gardener looked too glad to see him. He only nods to the two men following Tim. 
<p>
Tim walks in and finds the house dusty, chilly, and silent. "Where is everyone," he asks the gardener.
<p>
"Dismissed," the gardener says, looking down at the floor.
<p>
One agent whispers to Tim, "How will you know where to find him in all these bloody hidden rooms?"
<p>
"I know one room he always was in." For a moment, Tim wonders if his father changed more than he thought. However, he keeps going down a remembered path. 
<p>
It isn't as easy as he expected. In ten years, new walls, new doors, and new dead ends spring up. Some halls have no light, and the agents had to use their torches. The agents silently thank Tim for coming with them, since the map bears little relation to the actual labyrinth within a house. 
<p>
Tim walks down one hall, then walks backwards. He taps his foot onto the floor. "We're here."
<p>
One of the agents says, "How do you know," smacking on his fading torch.
<p>
"Favorite room. His office. I was the only one who knew where it was, after Mom died. Not even the gardener." Tim lifts up a trapdoor on the floor and walks down stairs. The agents, after shrugging at each other, follow him.
<p>
Tim knocks on something that could be a wall. "Timothy," a muffled voice says, "is that you?" Tim opens the door.
<p>
Some things have changed in ten years. The office was no longer neat, with correspondence, ledgers, and old books around. The bookshelves were bare, and the desk was covered with newspapers. Tim notices a lot of them detailed German defeats, mixed in with wince-inducing fascist broadsides. His father was in a graying shirt, a thin coat, and threadbare pants. His brown eyes, much like Tim's, stared at the agents with contempt and in shock. He grips a unopened butterscotch pudding can. 
<p>
One of the agents says, "Sir, did you think you would hide here forever?"
<p>
Tim's father ignores the agent and looks at Tim. "I almost hoped you were dead," Tim's father says in a paper-like mumble.
<p>
Tim shakes his head and the agents lead his father out.<p>
</i>
I find a slope near some trees and crouch in. I rely on hearing to figure when it is safe for me to move. It is the only thing I can rely on now. I am not as cold as I was before, but I am a little wet. 
<p>
Look at me, I think, I'm in the trenches just like my father. That wasn't what my parents hoped for me. Never mind. They'll be happy to know that I do not want to die for any country. I just want to get out of this war alive. I just want to see Tim again.
<p>
Just then, I spot two soldiers standing near the depression. I crouch immediately. Looking at them more, I see that their backs are turned. I tell myself if they do turn around, just shoot. Otherwise, wait until they leave. It is a long wait. They talk and talk about a bakery they went to as children, food shortages, and their sweethearts. I keep hoping they shut up and go away.
<p>
They walk away, but I don’t dare breathe a sigh of relief. I just scramble out and keep walking. I consider my options. I have a pistol and safe house directions.
<p>
First, there is no way this forest is unguarded. For all I know, I’m right in the Forbidden Zone, one against how many soldiers. Between escaping Paris and escaping Lille, someone, somewhere, has my description. There may be other places to hide, but I don’t know where they are. Someone may follow me to the safe house, so I have to take the most peculiar route to fool them. Plus, I am not sure how much longer the bread and cheese will last.
<p>
I check my pistol to see how many bullets are loaded. I get up out of the depression, and brush as much dirt off as I can. I continue walking in a zigzag direction, vaguely toward the safe house. I keep a close ear for other footsteps, as before.
<p>
The rest of the walk, I duck, dive, sneak, and run more than walk. I keep the directions in mind, trying to figure how to get there from this crooked path.
<p>
Night came too quickly for spring. Or maybe it feels like it. I find something like a leaf cover, and hide there for the night. I think I kicked a cadaver. No matter.
<p>
I consider hunting something bigger than a squirrel. Yeah, yeah, poaching is illegal like sabotage. I am most worried about fire attracting their attention. Never mind, I’ve spent nights hungry before.
<p>
<i>It took longer than Tim thought to get the deed to the house. It took even longer to get permission to house refugees. Now, it’s night, two, maybe three, months after he was kidnapped. He refuses to call it anything else. They asked him why he is going back when Danny and Louise was reportedly dead. He didn’t want to say he didn’t believe it. He just said that there were contacts he left hanging. It was partially true. He did have some folks needing forgery work.
<p>
They tell him so many times how to do it. Pull the cord, jump. He is still not sure he could remember. No matter. If gravity spares him, there are always the Germans.
<p>
To keep his mind off the inevitability, Tim thinks of other things. He wonders if Danny still has his violin. Perhaps with all that is happening, he lost it or sold it. He would feel a little sad if he did. He would understand, though. Danny’s survival means more than Tim’s whims. Was Louise working on her play before she died? Is she working on now? With disinformation and the good old rumor mill, Tim didn’t know if it is all true.
<p>
Sooner than he thinks, the plane door opens and he is fitted with a parachute and helmet. He closes his eyes, trying not to look at France spread out in the dark.
<p>
He jumps and stops thinking. Falling fast does that. 
</i>
<p>
I move out of the leaf cover and further into the woods. Plants haven’t finished budding, but animals are coming out of hibernation. I still have my pistol, a book of matches, and some bullets in my pockets. I duck when I hear human footsteps. 
<p>
I manage to shoot a rabbit. That night, I roast the rabbit over a small fire, watching for anyone attracted to the light. I nibble on edges of grass blades. I eat rabbit and I eat like a rabbit. I might be poaching, but what can I do?
<p>
I cannot sleep well tonight. Sometimes it gets too much and I need to close my eyes. But I keep myself awake so I can flee when I hear noises. So far, I saw no stream or pump during the day, so I am still dirty. I have no mirror, but I know that I have long hair and a beard. I look like either a prophet or monster.
<p>
Where am I going? I don't know. I have forgotten. I may have gone far off the path of the safe house. I don’t know what to do. At least I know that Tim is alive and not a traitor. But if M. Massion hasn't told anyone that I’m alive, then Tim doesn’t know either. So, in all likelihood, he stayed in England, perhaps grieving for me. I tried to remember what he told me about why he fought. He fought for he loved, and he loved me. Perhaps he will come back to fight for returning paintings and bringing back Poe, but he will not come back for me. I don't know where the other Clowns are. I have no way to get to Sweden. I have no contacts and this forest is no shelter. All I have is this stubborn determination not to pull the trigger on myself, and that is all I am relying on.
<p>
After dinner, I decide to get out of the woods. I duck behind haystacks while crossing a field southward. I hear an airplane. I stand still—-bomber or airdrop? I hear the flapping of sheets. Perhaps an airdrop. Perhaps food. A small voice inside says "Maybe someone to talk to." A more sinister voice growls "Maybe someone to rob."
<p>
I take my pistol with me, figuring whoever landed is an ally, but not a willing one. It's come to this, moving toward the one man who may not be a threat, and still readying myself for a fight. I can hear tripping and cursing—-I can not make out the words, but I know the rhythm. I peek out and see the parachute, white and flapping in the wind. The man jumps down with a thud, and runs. The footsteps grow louder. Oh God, he’s running in my direction.
<p>
I jump up at the man, holding a pistol and trying to see in the dark. The man immediately brings his hands up. I get a good look at him, and now I cannot move. I know those large brown eyes, looking sleepier than I remember, but still. I'm dreaming, sleep deprivation finally got me and I am just imagining it.
<p>
I was about to turn away he grabs me by the wrist. I see him up close, and his hair looks recently combed but steadily getting messier, and his clothes are cleaner.
<p>
Then he says it. "Danny? Danny, is that you?"
<p>
Two thoughts bubble up: Oh my God, it is Tim; and oh my God, we got to get out of the line of sight.
<p>
"The parachute," I whisper. He nods and points to the tree. He has the height, but I can pull the rest down when it is near me. We take a while to hold it up, pausing every few minutes to hear for strangers.
<p>
I lead him near a bigger stack of hay, covering us. We sit together, silent and facing each other. I finally whisper. "Your father. You never told me much about him."
<p>
He blinks at me. He apparently didn’t expect me to say that, or even know. "I told you I hated him. That was enough. I thought it was, anyway."
<p>
"You never told me he was a Blackshirt."
<p>
"How did you know?" He stops and tilts his head. "Do you care?"
<p>
I get a flash of insight. "I found out when I found Louise’s suitcase. She saved some unopened letters from your father—"
<p>
His eyes popped out and he leans toward me. "What? I told her to burn them--"
<p>
I get another flash of insight. "Paper lantern. Never mind. That’s the thing. I saw anger and hate in those letters. How did you avoid the hate and inherit the anger?"
<p>
Tim folds his hands and looks down at the ground. Maybe he doesn't know the answer to the question. Maybe the question hurt. He looks up at me. "I saw things that my father didn't. I could do things father couldn't do. I saw you, and all I could think about was getting home to you. When they told me you died, I don’t know, I wanted to see for myself. At least get your things. Dangerous, but I needed it."
<p>
"Did they tell you about Louise?"
<p>
He nods.
<p>
I start babbling, "It was my entire fault, Tim, because I thought she was safe there, I never expected her to open the door, and I should have switched places. . ."
<p>
His jaw juts out and he answers, "Then you would have been dead."
<p>
I had nothing to say; there is too much to say. I push through with only an instinct for survival, and yet I still feel like I shouldn’t survive. Like the death I should have had by now is given to other people: Leon, Herr Professor Acker, Louise, Mattheus, and maybe more. Then again, when should have my death happen: at nine, at seventeen, when the Nazis marched in, at the train tracks, now? If I know these things, maybe I would be unafraid of death.
<p>
I bow my head. My eyes are stinging and I can barely see the ground. When I blink, I see two drops of water--but is it water? I touch my eyes. What am I doing crying? I haven't cried since I was nine. I am about to wipe my eyes and think of answer, when Tim throws his arms around me. I must smell horrid, all sweat and dirt, and who knows what I look like? He pulls me closer and cups my head with his hand. I stay sitting because it feels good to be held, after who know how many months? It feels like years.
<p>
"I thought I'd never see you again." I murmur. I throw my arms around him and stay. I don’t need to beware. All I can hear is the wind and our breathing.
<p>
Maybe Mattheus is right. He thinks every person saved from a bombing is one more year to his life. Perhaps every person I helped get out of the way of the death camps added that. Maybe I am going crazy. Never mind, I have Tim right now. We will deal with what happens when it happens.
<p>
"I got off track. I was told where the safe house was, but I moved so far away, that I don’t know if I can get back."
<p>
Tim shakes his head. "I know the way. We can go together."
<p>
We arrive at the safe house at dawn. We sneak in the back. Tim asks if I still have my violin. I shake my head. Between escaping Paris and escaping wherever, there is no way I could have that violin or sheet music back. The music wasn't that great anyway, I tell myself.
<p>
I find a clear space on the floor and collapse with my eyes closed. I swear I hear whispers. I wonder if Tim is haggling over something. I cannot tell, I'm too tired.
<p>
When I wake up, a small boy of the house brings me a bucket of water, mirror and washcloth. As it turns out, my hair wasn’t that long and I had a small beard. I splash my face with water and wipe the dirt off my face and hands. I have no place to wash everything else though. Then again, my clothes are dirty.
<p>
Tim finally comes over to my side. "I have to go back to Paris. I am hearing stories that they are looting empty apartments. I wonder if they already looted my old place."
<p>
"Good chance it is long looted." I shrug.
<p>
"Maybe I’ll find your violin that way."
<p>
"I doubt it. It is not worth dying over. Maybe in a quieter place, I’ll get a new violin." I rub my eyes.
<p>
"Do you know where Louise's play is?"
<p>
"Not entirely. Do you?"
<p>
"No."
<p>
Tim sighs. "My grandmother’s things--I should have gotten them before . . ."
<p>
"There are a lot of things we should have done. We were, or are, amateurs in a bigger game."
<p>
"Did you keep our old code with the violin?"
<p>
I shake my head. "I made everyone memorize. Myself, too."
<p>
I breath deep. "Is there another reason you are here? You cannot be here just to find out if I am alive."
<p>
Tim bows down his head in embarrassment. "I cannot say." I glance to see papers folded under his arm. "I can only say we might find your violin. Maybe Louise’s play." It’s then I see his fingers are stained with ink. He is that well known for forgery?
<p>
The breakfast was small—maybe sausage and bread—but it was enough for now. My host cuts a bar of soap into a few small pieces and hands me one. I soak in cold water, watching the water turn gray. I wash my clothing in that same tub. I check for ticks on my greatcoat. Perhaps I am defeating the purpose.
<p>
I get out of the tub and wring the water out of the clothing. They have no towels, so I close the door so I can air dry.
<p>
I had a lot of time to think. Is Tim going to stay? On one hand, he might stay behind and do what he can with fake papers and cameras. On another, I wouldn't blame him if he left. I had been away from radio and papers, but I do see more soldiers and more arrests.
<p>
If he said he was going away, I wouldn't stop him. I'd still miss him. 
<p>
"I forgot how fuzzy you look naked." I jump and look behind me. Tim is looking at me with a smirk. He is walking toward me, broad swaggering strides. He puts his hand on my chest and pushes me against the wall. I don't stop him.
<p>
He kisses me soft and deep, and I kiss him back. I forgot how good it felt to kiss him. He wraps his arms around me. I can feel myself burn. I realize that I am also very hard.
<p>
He glides his fingers through my hair, and I swear he is still smirking. I shut my eyes and block everything. 
<p>
"I want to fuck you," he whispers, "or fuck me. I don't care."
<p>
I think I squeaked, "I don't know if we have to leave suddenly."
<p>
He leans his head against my shoulder. "You're right." He kisses me again, and his hands go just about everywhere, pinching, rubbing, and stroking. I have to keep from moaning, it might alert someone. The host, the little boy, the Gestapo, whatever.
<p>
Then I feel him licking down, down, down, taking my dick into his mouth. Small licks and long sucks. It's been so long, and if I don't hold on, he's going to be surprised.
<p>
"Is it allowed."
<p>
The sucking stops and he asks, "What?"
<p>
"May I come into your mouth?"
<p>
"I was hoping you would. It's been so long since I touched you."
<p>
I nod, and that goddamn soft and hot mouth is back sucking. I couldn't help the mewling while I shook during my release.
<p>
I pull Tim up. "What about you?"
<p>
He shakes his head. "Not yet. I've got something to tell you."
<p>
I know what he will say. "I think I know."
<p>
He shakes his head. "I have a house now. In England. You can come back with me. England needs another safe house. I'm going to make sure refugees and resistants have a safe place."
<p>
"You--you want me to come back with you. Away from France?"
<p>
"I know, and I thought about it, and I thought about why I started this. I tried to run away from my father, from my past, you know?"
<p>
I nod, realizing that he isn't just making sure he is safe.
<p>
"I told myself once that I would stand in their way. The Nazis, I mean."
<p>
He nods back. "Yeah, and the people, the people the Nazis are trying to get, they have a place. I had to fight the people arresting my father. I want, I want to do something good with something my father had, you know?"
<p>
He was right. "What about those without papers and a way to get to England? How will they know to go there?"
<p>
"Do you, do you want to lead them?" He runs his finger through my hair again, then trailing down. He brushes against my chest and my nipples.
<p>
"You make it hard to make rational decisions when you do that."
<p>
He takes his hand off my chest, looking innocent. "Sorry."
<p>
I take a deep breath. "Let me think about it for now. I just need to check if my clothing is dry."
<p>
Afternoon goes into evening, and Tim and I whisper plans. He has torches and a place to meet with the Lysander. I have a pistol and a way to protect him, should it come to that. The host told me of another safe house, a barn. He hands me what was his payment for the forgeries: a violin. I open it and I see my own sheet music.
<p>
"You find my violin?"
<p>
"Not really. It was just traded for some many things in the last few months."
<p>
I kiss him in gratitude, maybe in a way, in astonishment.
<p>
We walk long way, through fields and forest, and sometimes a street. At times, we had to hide. 
<p>
The worry over protecting Tim made me almost forget about the choice I had to make. I don't want to lose him, not again. Yet, all this time, all this running and all this work has gone for--will it be three years, I forgot. Tim did what he could, and he is doing what he could now. He is not a coward if he goes to England. However, it is not that easy for me. After all I have been through in Berlin and Paris, after all the friends I lost and the family I may never see again, I feel a vague pull to stay. I have to see this through. I still have to remain fighting. 
<p>
He might be right. We could be partners. I find ways to smuggle them into England and he provides them shelter. He is safe, at least. There may be a chance we will reunite after it all ends. However it ends. 
<p>
Night comes, and we are out in a field. We are both holding torches. I keep my eyes out, watching for soldiers. 
<p>
I lean in to whisper, "Tim, I'm staying. And you're right, I can smuggle people into England."
<p>
He nods. His eyes are closed and his head is down. "I understand. I understand you need to stay. That's why I suggested that." His lips are pursed. He is trying not to look sad, for me. 
<p>
I turn on my torch. I look around, check for people, aim the torch toward the sky, and place my free hand on my pistol. 
<p>
Faster than I expected, the Lysander touched down. We turn off our torches. Now here was the tough part.
<p>
I'm the first to say it. I may as well. "Good-bye" 
<p>
Tim kisses me on my forehead, almost discreetly. "Soon. I'll see you soon."
<p>
He holds my hand. I squeeze back. I want to believe this. He lets go and walks into the airplane. I run away just as he does; I'm not staying around to get arrested.
<p>
I walk until the first light of dawn to the barn, the next safe house. I open the door, find a bale of hay, and collapse.
<p>
Then a small high voice says in German, "The white elephant goes to Timbuktu for his funeral."
<p>
I lurch up and point my pistol. I see a small boy, holding a rifle toward me.
<p>
"How do you know German," the boy yells in French.
<p>
"I was a Berliner. How do you--"
<p>
The boy aims higher, almost embarrassed. "My mama was from Vienna--I don't believe you!"
<p>
A woman runs in with a torch. She aims it at me, and looks at the boy. "Paul, I know this man."
<p>
The boy turns his head toward the woman. "Miss, are you sure?" 
<p>
The woman nods and he puts down the rifle. I aim my own torch at her. Her hair is hidden in a kerchief, she isn't smirking anymore, but she still has the great legs. Miriam. 
<p>
"I apologize, Mit--Miss."
<p>
She nods. "Get some sleep."
<p>
"Maybe you can tell me what happened in the past few months."
<p>
"In the morning," she whispers.
<p>
Over breakfast, I hear of old friends dying in a shoot-out, of Marie trying to escape by climbing buildings and walking on clothing lines. Unfortunately, she was shot down when she got down. Richard will be broken-hearted when he hears this. Through Byzantine endeavors, Miriam got a barn from an aunt. They are part of a line now, directing airmen and refugees into safe countries.
<p>
"Do you need one more guide?"
<p>
"We always could use one more."
