Jacob lived a quiet and self-contained life. He lived on Birch Circle,
surrounded by friends, family (including his independent-minded aunt), 
and
concerned neighbors. His concerns were his band, playing percussion in 
the
school band, his role-playing game, escaping bullies and figuring out 
how to
get a girlfriend.
<p>
One day, he found his girlfriend, a visitor from Montana named Meg. 
That was
when his quiet life suddenly changed. 
<p>
For Meg has her own mission and her own life. She is a descendant of 
the
fae, supernatural societies that live parallel to and within humanity. 
One
of her own, a half-sidhe with a long-standing grudge, plans to destroy
humanity, street by street. She is starting with Birth Circle.  
<p>
Meg knows this, and knows she has to stop the war before it starts. 
What she
doesn't know is that she is not alone, that there are people who can 
help
her on Birch Circle.
<p>
When this is over, both their lives will change. Meg will find someone 
to
love, and a tight band of friends. Jacob will see his neighbors in new 
ways,
and discover unreal abilities of his own. The eccentric cat lady will 
be
revealed as a seer of sizable power. The puttering and quiet rabbi will 
be
revealed as a seasoned warrior in humanity's wars. Even Jacob's 
ordinary
friends--a sarcastic punk straining under the weight of being a 
'rabbi's
daughter,' an amiable and clean-cut boy, and a childlike joker with a
chaotic family life--will show their guile and ingenuity. This is what
happens in the first issue of the comic book series. 
<p>
They will find the Birch Circle war is only the beginning of their new
lives.
<p>
Together, they faced one of their neighbors going mad, best friends 
moving
away and draining away, and their own ups and downs. They broke up over
their different paths--Jacob into the music scene, Meg into the court 
to
intercede for other part-faes. I plan to write comic books about these
events, too.
<p>
The book about Birch Circle will take place in the year 2000. Since the 
18th
century, fae descendents have kept track of their ties, rivalries, and
accomplishments. Now it's out on CD ROM. It sets off a kidnapping, that
reveals a plot, that provokes a war. Meg is called to mediate between 
the
angry sea fae and the land people. Jacob and Meg reunite, but now bring 
new
friends and a new love to the group.  
<p>
Now they all have to survive the hound of Hell 
turned
into a human, tricksters, two gods gone mad, a biological weapon aimed 
at
fae, armies of the angry dead, and a deal with the devil himself. Only 
Meg
is powerful, but they will find a way.
