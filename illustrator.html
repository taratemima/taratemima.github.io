I will need an illustrator for the comic book parts of Birch Circle and the cover of the book.  I like Dave MacKean, the Pre-Raphaelites, Terry Moore, Milerna, and some art that startles between anime-style and realistic drawings. I rather look at what you got, however, before I dismiss it sight unseen.
