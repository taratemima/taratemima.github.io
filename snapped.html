<BODY>
<P>
I snapped for six monthes. Snapped how? From what?

<P>
It happens sometimes, when I have a little more money than I usually do. Even
if it's only five dollars or even a dollar. Instead of saving it, I spend it.
Some purchases I don't regret. But mostly I buy food. Usually some kind of 
full meal, and a dessert beside. Maybe two candy bars. 

<P>
I had a budget all written out. Just enough to help me survive if I didn't 
find a job immediately after, during the first week of work where I don't get
paid. But I fucked that up.
 
<P>
As a kid, I always have to accept that Mom's monthly check didn't allow for
the small luxuries that were on the TV. It wasn't until later I fully 
understood what "welfare" meant. And I hated it. I hated this feeling of 
dreams deferred, of hunger. I wasn't hungry for food really, just the feeling
of being like everyone else seemed like. Able to get by, afford nice things,
be "normal."

<P>
I can't say why exactly I did. It's almost I like to push things till they break, especially when it comes to money. I am afraid of not eating, not having something to get by, Exchanging more insecurity for temporary security.

<P>
So I snapped. I'm okay. I can survive. It may mean bills will be late this 
month, but I will be okay. They will get paid and I will pay them on time 
soon after. That is, if I don't snap again. If I can save judicially, go
without, accept that I am not "normal". Accept that I am that dirty word 
"poor."

<P>
For the sake of never going without again, I better.
