Alice Miller is a psychologist with the controversial hypothesis in two parts: violence is rooted in repressed knowledge of childhood abuse, and that the rise of Hitler had a lot to do with child-rearing ideas around in Germany, which involved very little affection and a lot of physical discipline (into even outright child abuse). I do not entirely agree with her, but I am coming closer to her POV, reading Lackoff's <i>Don't Think About the Elephant</a> and two ways of thinking about a family. See, 'obedience' and 'discipline' are decent concepts, but take too far, they become justification for following oppressors and oppressing others. It also gave me some insight on what a willful and bright child like Daniel would face from his elders.

<a href="http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/~os0tmc/occupied/resist.htm">An entry on Occupied France</a> on a web page for a university course on 'France Between the Wars.' On it was an important point that influenced how I wrote the characters:

<i>France's diverse immigrant community made a massive, and frequently forgotten contribution to the resistance movement and to the liberation of France. In 1939 it is estimated that there were around 2.5 million foreigners in France, or 6% of a total population of 41 million. . . Most of these migrants arrived after World War I to help resolve the labour shortage and were therefore what we might call economic migrants. However, many arrived in the 1930s in response to events in Europe: Italian anti-fascists, Spanish Republicans and assorted members of the International Brigade, German anti-Nazis, and, of course, Jews fleeing the violent anti-semitism of Central, Eastern and, increasingly, Western Europe. There was a particularly dramatic wave of Catalan migrants (around 500,000) in January 1939 after the fall of Barcelona.</i>

Some books I read:

Soliders of the Night
Not the Germans Alone
Wine and War
The Vilde Affair
They Fought Back
Down and Out in France and England, by George Orwell

Occupation: The Ordeal of France 1940-1944 by Ian Ousby
Review: "This history of The Occupation uncovers a reality more complex, more human and ultimately more moving than the myths that have grown up after the event."

Books to look at:

Anything by Primo Levi
Bernhard Schlink's Der Vorleser which I believe has been translated into English.

The Silence of the Sea/Le Silence De La Mer : A Novel of French Resistance During the Second World War by 'Vecors'
During the spring of 1942, this novel was clandestinely published in Nazi-occupied Paris and written by the then little known cartoonist Jean Bruller, alias 'Vercors'. It impressed contemporaries as 'the most moving, the most deeply human novel that we have had the opportunity to read since the beginning of the German occupation' ('Les Lettres Francais'). Its message, appropriate to the early stage of French resistance, was that French people should abstain from communicating with the Germans.

Petain's Crime by Paul Webster
The crime of Marechal Philippe Petain, Great War hero and 'national saviour' after the Fall of France, was complicity in the persecution and mass murder of Jews. The facts have long been covered in secrecy and shame in France, but the full story is now told in this book.

French Resistance 1940-1944 by Raymond Aubrac

Agents for Escape: Inside the French Resistance, 1939-1945 by Andre Rougeyron, translated by Marie-Antoinette McConnell

'Vive La France': The French Resistance During World War II (First Books) by Robert Green
