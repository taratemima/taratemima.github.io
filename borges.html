   <title>The Speech Act Analysis of Borges' The Aleph</title>
</head>
<body>
Jorge Luis Borges' short story
_The Aleph_ is built on the antagonistic relation between Carlos Argentino
Daneri and the narrator. It is also built on the theme that you cannot
know everything about the&nbsp; world, that there is a such thing as too
much information. Looking at the text through several methods--speech act
theory, lexicon, and narrative speech--yields some interesting insights
into the characters and the text.
<p>The role of the narrator is different in this story than from Borges'
other short stories and prose poems. While often the narrator is omniscient,
detailing and even controlling the thoughts and actions of the characters,
the narrator in _The Aleph_ is not at all&nbsp; like that. His name is
also Borges, and he is grieving for a long-dead&nbsp; friend. He wants
to preserve every piece of information related to her, and complains about
any change--like advertisements for cigarettes near her house.
<p>There are autobiographical elements--Borges the author did write a short
story called The Sharper's Cards, the story is in Borges' home country
of Argentina, the places Carlos Argentino wrote about are real places.
The events of the story is filtered by his limited perspective.
<p>Borges and the reader meet Carlos Argentino five years after the death
of Beatriz. He is described in comparison with Beatriz. Where as Beatriz
was slender and tall, Carlos Argentino was "pink, overweight, gray-haired,
of fine features." Like Beatriz, he had beautiful hands. Much like Borges
the writer, Carlos Argentino works in a library (described as "unreadable")
and writes poetry. The house itself is compared in related to Beatriz--the
pictures, an "unplayed piano, a vase that held no flowers (rough translation
of the original Borges, 165)." It is hinted that the house is neglected
by Carlos Argentino in pursuit of his vision.
<p>His vision is to describe the Earth in excruciating detail. In that
regard (judging by the excerpt in the English translation, and the three
samples in the Spanish), he succeeds; the stanzas are packed with detail.
However, it isoverloaded--with literary references and with Carlos Argentino's
ego--to the point of being meaningless. Borges continues on the theme of
uselessness later in the story. It is not, however, too far from what drives
Borges.
<p>Borges' acquaintance with Carlos Argentino starts off with Carlos Argentino
disclaiming about the modern man. Interestingly enough, the things he catalogs
has the lexical property of [+visual] and [+indirect experience] (e.g.,
phonographs and bulletins, among other things). Then Borges asked for him
read some poetry, "if only a small sample." Carlos Argentino responds by
grabbing "a thick stack of papers," violating the Cooperative Principle
of Borges' request. This sets up for another violation later in the story.
<p>What is more interesting is how Carlos Argentino talks about the poem,
almost if he was a sycophantic critic entrusting this poem to posterity.
The sentences have plenty of subordinate clauses and is in the passive
in the English edition. The Spanish has them in the active, but still with
lots of subordinate clauses. Like the poem, it is stuffed with references
to literary movements and persons. He is not kidding when he talks about
"thirty centuries of literature" in those four stanzas.
<p>The poems, however, violate our expectations. In the inaugural canto,
he builds by alluding to Homer and Hesiod, then ends it with "autour ma
chambre"--"around my room" in French. All this just for a house tour, the
reader wonders. In his Australian sheep farm poem, he takes four lines
and several fancy words to discourse about the dullness of the pastoral
tasks and the superior life of a literary critic (or at least it seems
to say--my Spanish is rusty). This is a reverse of the whole history of
pastoral poetry, from Sidney onward.
<p>In the poems themselves, there are formal versions of common Spanish
words ("auque" as opposed to "algunos" or "ellos"--all meaning "they").
He also uses the tu command form ("sepan" (know)), the prerogative of someone
who thinks you ought to listen to him. Borges goes into later about "blue
once being good enough for him," but later he "wallow[ed] in 'azures',
<br>'ceruleans,' and 'aquamarines'" (Borges, trans. DiGiovanni 20 ), and
inventing new forms of milky, like 'lactinacious.' Carlos Argentinos goes
so far as to invent neologisms like 'celestewhite,' which to Carlos Argentino
"suggests&nbsp; [emphasis in the original] the sky (Borges, trans. DiGiovanni,
20 )."
<p>He is enthusiastic in regard to word choice, but it all seems senseless,
with Borges quoting him. He already set up the reader by saying that "[Carlos
Argentinos'] mental activity" was "passionate, continuous, far-reaching,
and above all, meaningless. (rough translation of original, Borges, 166)"
The dull poetry only reinforces the truth condition of what he is saying.
Not only is he angry at Carlos for writing down something so bad, but for
being there instead of Beatriz. That comes out poignantly when Borges talks
about the telephone. He's now annoyed he was that the instrument
<br>that let him hear Beatriz's voice now lets him hear Carlos Argentino'swhining.
Of course, no counterexamples have been provided. Borges the narrator may
be at the mercy of Carlos Argentino's poetry recitation, but Borges has
the last word!
<p>Another feature is what form of speech that characters used. While Carlos
Argentino used representatives, expressives, verdictives and directives,Borges
used representatives mainly. Borges used those forms too, but often used
verdictives and expressives in his narrative. Almost as if Carlos Argentino
thinks he knows the truth, while Borges is still trying to verify.
<p>It goes beyond that. They are speaking on different lexical and synatic
bases. In a lot of the narration, Carlos Argentino is the Agent, while
Borges is Experiencer, Patient, and Agent, but mostly Patient. The verbs
used in connection with Carlos Argentino deal with action--"had to kill,"
"remarked," "dealt." Borges' verbs deal with thought--"agreed," "began
worrying," "felt," "realized." This is in keeping with lexical features
noticed in his other works--use of blurriness in verbs and adjectives,
for instance (Barrenechea, 133).
<p>There are distinct patterns in how the narrative treats Borges the character
and Carlos Argentino. Direct speech is often used in relation to Carlos
Argentino (maybe once or twice for Borges). Free direct speech is also
used in relation to Carlos Argentino, such as the description of his word
choice in the English translation. Incidentally, the English uses free
indirect speech more, especially when replacing certain passages that were
originally direct speech. Rarely is Borges quoted--when he is, it is either
in the form of indirect speech or narrative report of the speech act. There
is no incident ofslipping--Borges the writer makes it clear whose Borges
and whose
<br>Carlos Argentino.
<p>That is different from how thought is described. Never does Borges the
writer quote Carlos Argentino's thoughts, even directly. All is known is
Borges' thoughts, in the indirect to be exact. This is in keeping with
the position of the limited point of view of the narrator. All we know
about Carlos Argentino is his poetry, his speeches, and what Borges thinks
of him.
<p>Later on he asks Borges to ask a famous author to write a preface to
his book _The Earth_. Before that, he condemns the "modern day mania for
preface" as denounced by Cervantes in his preface to Don Quixote. The reader
is caught off guard by this violation of speech expectations. If he hates
prefaces, why is he quoting someone's preface and asking for someone to
write a preface? Oblivious doesn't cover it. Irony never occurs to Carlos
Argentino, to hear Borges--all that matters is him being thought as a great
poet.
<p>Later in the story, Carlos Argentino is horrified when he hears that
his landlords are planning to tear down his house. "'My home! My grand
and ancestral home!' . . .seeming to drown his despair in the music of
his words.(Borges, trans. DiGiovanni 22 )" Then his words, and his matter
of saying them changed. As he talks about the Aleph he found as a child,
he is truly&nbsp; "so overcome by his worries that he forgets to be pompous."
He uses active tense sentences, and hardly any polysyllabic words or literary
references. He repeats the word "mine" in reference to the Aleph. In the
Spanish version, he uses the stronger version of the first person singular
possessive--"mio" instead of "mi." It turns that this is how he wrote his
poem. The possibility of "the only place on
<br>earth where all places are" seems underwhelming, when Carlos Argentino's
poetry makes it clear he doesn't have a mind able to understand it.
<p>After Borges agrees to see it, he becomes afraid. He immediately assumes
that Carlos Argentino is mad and compares his mania to Beatriz's "moods."
He concludes that madness is common among the Viterbos/Daneris. He already
assumed that the truth condition has been violated on Carlos Argentino's
part, and feels a "spiteful elation (Borges, trans. DiGiovanni 24). We
can only
<br>concluded that "[d]eep down [they] had always detested each other.
(Borges, trans. DiGiovanni 24 )."
<p>As he goes in the cellar, he lies down on a sack, and starts to panic.
"The blackness . . .seemed to me absolute. For the first time, I realized
the danger I was in:&nbsp; . . .locked in a cellar by a lunatic. after
gulping down a glassful of poison! I knew that back of Carlos' transparent
boasting lay a
<br>deep fear that I might not see the promised wonder. To keep his madness
undetected . . .he had to kill me. [emphasis in the original] (Borges,
trans. DiGiovanni 25). In there, he is absolutely certain of one thing:
Carlos Argentino is not saying what really is going on.
<p>"Then I saw the Aleph . . ." In the beginning of his narrative about
the Aleph, he raises some interesting questions about the nature of language
and experience.
<p>The narrator is at a loss at what to do. "All language is a set of symbols
whose use among its users assumes a shared past. How, then, can I translate
into words the limitless Aleph, which my floundering mind can scarcely
comprehend?" Carlos Argentino tried and fell on his face. All the narrator
can do is passively look on and try to tell the reader what he sees.
<p>Here lies the futility of Carlos Argentino's quest. He wants to show
every aspect of the world, but how can you when the person can't see it?
Language is finite--the Aleph is infinite. Seeing that Carlos Argentino's
mind is even more finite, the task becomes close to impossible. "Such explicit
<br>treatment of a revelation is an unusual feature in Borges' fiction,
where the narrative often breaks off immediately before the vision . .
.readers find out what the oracle divulged, but the contents turn out to
be worthless. (Lindstrom, 55) "
<p>This ties in neatly with what others have noted about the abstract,
uncertain tone of his stories. According to one, he was influenced by Mauthener,
who said that all human knowledge is tied in language, "all language is
metaphorical and approximate--therefore, knowledge is relative, marked
by imprecision and error." (Barrenechea, 154)
<p>The narrator falls back on successive narration, telling the reader
what he sees as he sees it. The sentences generally follow the pattern
of&nbsp; "I saw . . ."--active, one or two sentence or simply subordinate
clauses. When he does feel something, he makes a note of it. That's all
he can do in the face of the rush of images.
<p>In keeping with Borges' obsession with the inexactness of language and
knowledge, a common metaphor is subverted. It is often believed that "seeing
is understanding." It is not in the case of The Aleph. Even with the Aleph,
even after seeing all the scenes of the world, Borges and Carlos Argentino
are no better off. Borges may be able to see all of his beloved Beatriz,
just as he was obsessed with in the beginning, but he saw what he didn't
want to see--her obscene letters, her rotting cadaver. At the end, he notes
that he finally slept without dreaming of what he saw. Carlos Argentino
recieves no enlightenment, just more subjects for bad poetry. Naomi Lindstorm
gives more insight into this:"`Daneri is even slower to grasp that to be
absolutely all-encompassing, or
<br>even completely representive, is both an impossible and a useless enterprise.
<br>He determinedly loads more and more heterogeneous elements into his
monstrous poem, in defiance of the commonsense principle that art requires
selectivity and the repetition of significant uniformities (56)."
<p>Carlos Argentino's language changes after showing Borges the Aleph.
For one thing, it's less formal. He uses the tu form of verbs and the salutation
"che," meaning comrade, in the Spanish version. Someone commented that
he sounded like a huckster.&nbsp; In English, he uses active tense, Borges'
name, and the phrase "hell of a show." He is described whispering "Did
you see it? In colors?" He is no longer disclaiming--he is asking.
<p>From a face-threatening act theory, Borges and Carlos Argentinos' interaction
is interesting. There is no incident of overt confrontation until toward
the end. By Borges' account, he spent most of the time avoiding Carlos
Argentino. It is only when Carlos Argentino disrupts relations by talking
in the informal does Borges try to save face.
<p>Borges perceives Carlos Argentino's drop in formality as a face threatening
act, making him someone he doesn't want to be--a comrade of a bad poet
and the obnoxious relative of a unrequited love. He combats this by changing
the subject and being formal. He tells Carlos Argentino, using his full
name, to go out and get some fresh air, pretending that nothing unusual
<br>has happened and that they shared nothing. Borges, on his part, violated
the Cooperative Principle, talking about something that had nothing to
do with the Aleph. However, to save face, it was necessary.
<p>At the end of the story, Carlos Argentino wins second prize for parts
of his unfinished poem. His diction is still pompous and allusion-heavy,
but now it is in the active tense with short sentences. Some things have
not changed, however. The reader has to wonder--why does Carlos Argentino
think that winning second prize in a literary contest is the "reddest feather
in my turban, the most caliph of rubies? (Borges, trans. DiGiovanni&nbsp;
29)."
<p>Once again, Borges gets the last laugh. He violates the truth condition
of the whole narrative by suggesting that what Carlos Argentino had and
what he saw was not the real Aleph. In fact, there are references to all
sorts of mirrors.Not only was the images given by the Aleph useless, but
false too. He quotes from several sources--Burton, and his references to
other mirrors, other ways
<br>of seeing everything in the world. In the end, he doesn't know if he
really did see the Aleph. All he knows is his fading memory.
<p>In the end, Borges seems to say, that is all people know. He demonstrates
this by the characters of the narrator and Carlos Argentino.
