<p>
If we weren't impeccable libertarians, we'd be hollering for legislation to
require media to publish a what-we-really-meant-to-say paragraph on anything
having to do with culture or society, to explain why the
Internet-as-addictive-scourge story and similar tales routinely arise. Such
a policy might actually be of service to anxious news consumers, who are
barraged daily with warnings about the perils of TV, computers, rap music,
coffee, sex, cars, crime, the educational system, food additives and
colorings, artificial sweeteners, and children's toys, clothes, and books.
<p>
Media Rant's proposed truth-in-media paragraph would read this way:
<p>
"We know this story is absurd, and if you think about it for five seconds,
you'll think so, too. But we seem to have lost the ability as a medium to
cover the reality of change and to provide a sense of perspective and
proportion to the various dangers facing us and our children. We do this
because we have become increasingly lazy, unwilling to figure out the truth
ourselves, and more and more reliant on polls, spokespeople, academics, and
therapists whose livelihood, funding, and place in society often depends on
their interests being perceived as urgent and timely. Reporting on these
doomsday scenarios makes us feel relevant and useful: life is dangerously
unpredictable, but we'll keep you safe if you read our perpetual warnings -
and thus you won't forsake us for all this glitzy new online stuff. We
continue in this manner even as the economics and demographics of our
industry make it clear with each passing day that we are becoming useless,
irrelevant, and mistrusted precisely because of dumb reporting like this."
