<p><font size="4">Sleeping Around (That Voice Again)?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">by Tara Edwards</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Still I hear that sharp tongue talking,
Talking tangled words.<br>
I can sense the danger--just listen to the wind.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't sleep around.&quot; Who said it
and why and what in response to doesn't matter now, but the words
still sting. Never mind that I was straightforward about
everything that was going on, including the fact that I was
involved with another guy. I wanted to tell him &quot;I
don't,&quot; but I didn't have the words to explain to him the
difference between sleeping with others and sleeping around. Then
again, I don't think he wanted to hear it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I want to be with you, I want to be clear
But each time I try its the voice I hear<br>
Hear that voice again.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Now I reminded of that accusation again. I met
a guy over Labor Day. Funny, sweet, musical, really attracted to
me (and I to him)--and oh, in a monogamous relationship. Okay, so
I'll just get to know him better as friend.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Oh, I'm hearing right and wrong so
clearly There's must be more than this.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sooner or later, as we get to know each other
as friends, my mildly interesting love life will come up. So will
the p-word: polyamory. I have hinted at it, but not out right
said it to him. It's not a word in Websters, and it's not
something everyone can get into. That's fine.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I want you close, I want you near, I cant
help but listen but I dont want to hear<br>
Hear that voice again.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">What worries me is that the same accusation of
sleeping around will come up. The only time I really consider
myself sleeping around was when I was 18 and slept with three
people--one I didn't want to be with, two I wanted to be with
more than one night, but who didnt feel that way. It wasn't the
casual sex that made it sleeping around in the worst sense. I was
not emotionally connected with these people. I felt afraid to
tell them what I really wanted and bowed to their whims, even
when it meant I wasn't going to see or speak to them. I didn't
trust them. Unfortunately, in most people's minds, like
Mr.&quot;I don't sleep around,&quot; having more than one partner
is sleeping around. That automatically makes you shallow,
immature, and a slut. Someone once called poly relationships a
cop-out--considering all the thinking I've done about the people
I was involved with, all the emotion, that really hurt.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I can get so scared . . .&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I don't know what this guy will think. Or maybe
that's not the problem. I know that I can be needy, lonely, and
look for attention from others to fill it. I doubt, however, that
my personal hurt will automagically be solved by having only one
partner. Or even if all my problems were solved I would
automagically look for only one partner. I also refuse to believe
that being polyamorous means that I'm shallow and immature. I may
be pretty young, but I know that maturity has nothing to do with
age--or relationship style.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So, I talked myself into the answer. If the
Labor Day guy ever asks about what poly means, I will tell him.
He doesn't have to consider himself that (it's one hell of a
topic to broached to your long time SO), he can just be my
friend, I just want him to consider that what I do is more
complex than sleeping around.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What I carry in my heart, brings us so
close or so far apart.<br>
Only love can make love.&quot;</font></p>
