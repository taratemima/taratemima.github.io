<p class=MsoNormal>Leviathan, behemoth, Goliath, philistine, hallelujah,
jubilee, jeremiad, amen, messiah, cherub, seraphic, Sabbath, Solomonic,
satanic, hosanna, Armageddon are words one Forward columnist put as Hebrew
words from the Bible. So did, however, emerald, elephant, Levite, and angel.
Some common English idioms were originally translated from the Hebrew, such
'put an end to' and 'to pour one's heart out.' The Bible isn't the only source
for Hebrew words. Think of rabbinical Judaism-Mishnah, chuppah-or Israel-kibbutz,
kippah. Looking at Hebrew-derived words, one can trace the course of Biblical
translation, English Jewish populations, and the formation of the State of
Israel. A definite sea change took place in Hebrew-derived words, not only were
they straight from Hebrew and not by the route of Greek, Latin, and Arabic, but
also moved from different religious and secular concerns, from Christianity to
science, to rabbinical Judaism to world politics. This is a small attempt to
tell a brief history of these developments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nearly all of the Hebrew words from the Bible fall into
three categories, according to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Forward</i>
article (p.10). The first one are words coined from Hebrew names but having an
independent meaning of their own, taking it from the biblical narrative surrounding
the word. This includes Goliath, philistine, jeremiad and Solomonic. Modern
Hebrew has some words that fall into that, such as Hadassah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second category of Hebrew words from the Bible is words
whose exact meaning was not known to the Bible's translators, so they left it
in the original rather than have to attempt a guess. Among those words are
leviathan (Modern Hebrew means "whale"), cherub, and seraph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third category are words whose meaning was understood by
translators, but had no adequate term to render it. The most famous is Sabbath,
and its different derivations in English are discussed later. Many
Judaism-specific terms outside of the Bible fall into that category, too. In
recent years, the Hebrew original is winning over the English translation, with
'Yom Kippur' being preferred over 'Day of Atonement,' and 'tefillim' being
preferred to 'prayer.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One such word,
'tzedekeh,' will be discussed later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of the Hebrew loanwords in English first were Greek and
Latin borrowings, due to the influence of the Septuagint version of the Bible,
then later the Vulgate. What Old English translations existed were psalters,
hymns, and religious instruction for churchgoers and monks. Some very common,
Christianity-related words came from these Hebrew-through-Greco-Latin
borrowings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Satan is Latin, then Greek, derived from 's&#257;t&#257;n,'
Hebrew for 'adversary, one who plots against another,' from 's&#257;tan,' the
verb infinitive 'to plot, to oppose.' According to the OED, "In the Old
Testament the Heb. word ordinarily denotes a human adversary, but in some of
the later portions (Job, Chronicles, Zechariah, and Psalms) it occurs (chiefly
with definite article) [it occurs] as the designation of an angelic being
hostile to mankind, who tempts men to evil and accuses them to God."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Myrrh was from the Greek '&#956;&#973;&#961;&#961;&#945;,'
derived from the Hebrew 'm&#333;r,' and entered English around 825 C.E., from a
Vespers translation of Psalms. The meaning of the fragrant gum and products
from it remain consistant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Angel is, according to the OED, an early Teutonic (Gothic,
too) adaptation of "the L[atin] angel-us, or G[reek]
'&#259;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#959;s'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>- 'a messenger,' used by the LXX to translate Hebrew 'mal'&#257;k,' in
full</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>'mal'&#257;k-y&#277;h&#333;w&#257;h' 'messenger of Jehovah';
whence the name and doctrine of angels passed into Latin and the modern
languages." The Lindisf translation first put the word in English language
writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amen is, according to the OED, a. Latin '&#257;m&#275;n,'
apparently from the Hebrew word '&#257;m&#275;n,' 'certainty, truth,' "from the
Hebrew verb &#257;man to strengthen, confirm; used adverbially 'certainly,
verily, surely' as an expression of affirmation, consent, or ratification of
what has been said by another (Deut. xxvii.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26, 1 Kings i. 36); adopted in Greek by the LXX., whence in
New Testament, and in early Christian use, in Greek and Latin, as a solemn
expression of belief, affirmation, consent, concurrence, or ratification, of
any formal utterance made by a representative; thus with prayers, imprecations,
confessions of faith. Apparently not so used in Old English, but translated by
'Sóðlice!,' 'Swá hit ys' or 'sý!' Added however as a concluding formula to Luke
and John in the Augustine Gospels." First recorded use was the Linsdisfell
Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aloe was the English translation of the Hebrew
'akh&#257;l&#299;m' and 'akh&#257;l&#333;th' (incidentally coming from Sanskrit
'aguru') for the fragrant resin of the aloe plant, originally found in the
Septuagint version of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. Aloe was also the
English translation for the Greek word for the bitter drug from that same plant,
'&#940;&#955;&#972;&#951;.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hell, while originally a Old Norse referring to the goddess
of the underworld, was used to translate the Hebrew 'sh&#277;&#333;l,' a word
meaning 'pit' and first used in the Vespers Psalter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The earliest English translation of the whole Bible was by
William Wyclif in 1362, working from the Vulgate. "William Tyndale, a scholar
fluent in 7 languages, left England to work on the first English translation
based on the original Hebrew and Greek. In 1525, smuggled copies of his New
Testament began circulating England," according to the writers at wycliffe.org.
No word on which texts, but could be from the Masoretic Hebrew text and the
Septuagint Greek text. Later came the Coverdale, in 1535, then the Geneva in
1560. As for James I, "James I (1564-1625), King of England, alarmed by all the
versions appearing, commissioned a group of biblical scholars to produce an
authorized version, combining the best of earlier translations. The Authorized
Version, written in the language of the day, appeared in 1611, the first Bible
produced by an authorized group of scholars," according to wycliffe.org. Along
with Greek scholars, some of England's major Hebraists were on that panel. Each
translation added new words. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is most interesting about the new words is that they
were not religious in nature, but refer to natural phenomena. Also, travel,
medical, law, and mystical texts first introduced some of the new words, not
just translations of the Bible. By the time King James commissioned the
translation, there was a strong Christian Hebraist community in Europe and in
England, willing to read ancient and rabbinical Jewish texts. Some of these
words refer to the mystical oral tradition of the Torah, called the Kabalah.
They were willing to look at words and concepts not found in the Psalters, even
as some of them denigrated their source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>English language and English identity really developed in
the seventeenth century. As more major English-language works were published
and read, "Biblical paradigms increasingly overwhelmed classical and folk
models (Shoulson, 355)." In religion, "[English] Protestantism . . .was greatly
influenced by an evolving extra-biblical Hebraism, one that extended beyond an
interest in the Hebrew of the Bible to include the writings of Jewish scholars of
the ancient and medieval past (Shoulson, 355)." Attitudes concerning the
authors of the works, of course, varied. They tended toward either respect for
scholarship by the far-flung, close-knit Contential Hebraists of the late
sixteenth and early seventeenth century, to the rants of George Withers,
translator of a 'metrical Psalms, about the perversity and stubbornness of the
Jewish people, to the image of England as a 'spiritual Israel,' heirs of the
Bible, whose language is best suited for universial understanding and adherence
to the Biblical authors' themes. Consulting rabbis about points of Hebrew
grammar, definitions of faith, and opinions on the New Testament did not just
result in the Bible translations English-speaking people still use. That period
"culminat[ed] in the Whitehall Conference of 1655-56 and the deliberation over
the readmission of the Jews to England (Shoulman, 355)."</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Much of the new words from Tynsdale, King James, and
individual translations were nature related, using more words from the Bible to
describe lands beyond the island. A small number will be examined here.
Elephant is found in the Celtic languages as a corrupted form of Latin, then
Greek. Some speculate that it was originally from the Hebrew 'eleph,' meaning
'ox.' Emerald was actually Greek, and used to translate the Hebrew
'n&#333;phek,' rendered in the Vulgate as 'carbunculus.' Cinnamon was
originally Latin, derived from the Greek, which itself was derived from the
Hebrew 'qinn&#257;m&#333;n,' found approximately 1430 in a book called <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bochas</i>. </p>

&quot;TYPE=PICT;ALT={kappa}&quot;<![endif]--><!--[if supportFields]><span
style='mso-element:field-end'></span><![endif]-->Alcohol was first written in
various travel and scientific books, and had come to mean two things. It means
either "The fine metallic powder used in the East to stain the eyelids, etc.:
powdered ore of antimony, stibnite, or antimony trisulphide" or "By extension
to fluids of the idea of sublimation (of extracting powder): An essence,
quintessence, or 'spirit,' obtained by distillation or 'rectification.'"</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The words itself is the French spelling of the Latin word,
derived from the Arabic word 'al-koh'l,' used for a fine powder to stain the
eyelids. The Arabic word itself comes from the Hebrew 'kahala,' from the root
'kahal,' 'to stain.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cabal was a French and Spanish writing of 'cabbala,' which
itself is the Latin writing of the Hebrew 'qabb&#257;l&#257;h,' meaning
'tradition,' from the root, 'qibb&#275;l,' 'to receive.' While the word 'cabal'
once referred to "the Jewish tradition as to the interpretation of the Old
Testament" (which is in PDE 'Kabalah'), 'cabal' now means "secret or private
intrigue of a sinister character formed by a small body of persons," which
entered around 1646. 'Cabbala' entered around 1521, and 'cabal' followed in
1611.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After re-admittance in 1695, the words came in hard and
fast, most from texts explaining the Jews, and others from Jewish religious
works in English.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Purchas' <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pilgrimage</i>,
he makes many references to different Jewish practices, introducing into
English words like tefillin, Midrash, and tallith (now tallis). E. Chilmead
traditionally wrote three or so volumes of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Leon
Modena's Historical Rites, Customes, Etc. of Jews</i> in 1650 and introduced
into the English language chazzan (commonly cantor is used in lieu of that),
hesped, megillah (Hebrew, 'roll' or 'scroll'), mezuzah, and mitzvah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As noted, the study of the Kabalah brought in some words.
Mecubalist came from the same root as 'cabbala,' only now written in Hebrew as
'mequbb&#257;l,' 'one who receives,' with the English suffix -ist added. It is
only found in one text, a treatise on physiognomy in 1653. The few times I do
see the word is in English language works on the Kabalah, and it is spelt
'mekubalist.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shekinah is found in
religious works, both Jewish and Christian (who used it to refer to Jesus) to
refer to the presence of God, with the cherubim or in any holy place, and is
Hebrew, from the root 'sh&#257;kan,' 'to dwell, to rest.' Zohar means
literally, 'light, splendor,' and is the title of a major Kabbalistic text, in
the form of an allegorical interpretation of the Pentateuch. It first entered
in 1682, spelt 'zoar.' Gematria seems to be itself a Greek loanword, from
'&#947;&#941;&#969;&#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#943;&#940;,' our source for the
word geometry. Gematria is a method of interpreting the Hebrew Scriptures by
interchanging words whose letters has the same numerical value when added. It
is first used in Goad's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Celestial Bodies</i>.
Cardimelech is specifically mystical concept in early medicine, 'a supposed
active principle in the heart, superintending what are now called the vital
functions,' according to the OED. It is a Greco-Hebrew hybrid loanword, adding
the Greek word for 'heart' and the Hebrew word for 'king.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>English Jews assimilated fast into the culture, and found
most of their identity and education in English. As generations grow up, more
of them lose their multilingual orientation and write and speak solely in
English. Meanwhile, with the Enlightenment in England, scientific knowledge and
skepticism found common ground in Anglician erudition, along with continued
study of Hebrew from the 16<sup>th</sup> century to the 18<sup>th</sup>. When
Anglician theologians and Hebraists propose newer, better, more Christianized
translations of Hebrew Bible texts, the leading lights of the English Jewish
community fight back. While the English Christians have gotten familiar with
Hebrew and woven it with their national and religious identity, the English
Jews have done the same with English. Perhaps this is linked to Hasaklah and
Geiger's Reform Judaism in Germany; perhaps it is their unique response to the
'clergymen-scientists' of England.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The focus on Bishop Robert Lowth and David Levi is not
accidental. In addition to writing a dictionary and rules of prescriptive
English grammar called <i>Short Introduction to English Grammar </i>(1762),
Lowth was also a predominant Anglican clergyman. He set up another quest for
the English language when he translated the Book of Isaiah, in 1778. Remember
that Isaiah is an important prophetic work, from which Christians get a good
part of the messianic prophecies that they believed are fulfilled by Jesus. The
translation was as much a matter of national identity and education as his
rules of grammar, but it was a lot more:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Lowth had established the full significance of his
project from the first page of his handsome volume, dedicated to the King of
England, as a part of 'Sacred Criticism, which to the honour of this Nation,
and to the Universal benefit of the Christian Church . . .' the bishop's
crusade on the behalf of a new Christian text of the Old Testament, both
artistically and religiously superior to the older version taken from the Jews,
was no small matter to be taken lightly. Lowth's "declaration of independence"
accomplished by the weight of the full Christian political and religious
establishment, was meant to undermine Jewish claims of being the sole arbiters
of the test (Ruderman, 76).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David Levi was not a clergy member, but he was an English
Jew who consciously wrote for Christians, deists, and Jews in the English
language. He is not very well known, because writing solely in English limited
his audience in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. A hat maker, he was also
accomplished in Hebrew and a great reader of Christian Biblical scholarship and
history. "Levi assigned himself the formidable tasks of becoming Anglo-Jewry's
primary educator as well as its principal apologist and defender against the
verbal assaults of Christian theologians, biblical critics, Evangelicals,
deists, and atheists. He was a one-man anti-defamation league and his list of
publications constituted a virtual Judaic library in their own right (Ruderman,
57)." Lowth's translation was especially important-"in the new environment of
Christian Hebraism, the notion that a Christian, especially one with the
credentials of the erudite Lowth, could understand the Hebrew text and
translate it more effectively and more poetically than any contempory Jew was
surely a painful pill for so proud a Jew as Levi to swallow (Ruderman, 76)." He
not only by writing Dissertations on the Prophecies of the Old Testament,
taking the bishop to task for inaccurate statements about Jewish beliefs and
rituals, mistakes of the Hebrew idiom, and whole idea of collation (comparing
different manuscripts and debating which verse was oldest and truest) and
translation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In one thing, Levi and Lowth were alike. Lowth saw a
pressing need to translate the Bible into English for enlightenment of the
English-speaking Christian who knew very little to none Latin or Hebrew. Levi
saw a pressing need to write Jewish religious education material in English for
the enlightenment of the English-speaking Jew who knew very little Hebrew. Among
other things, Levi wrote <i>A Succinct Account of the Duties, Rites, and
Ceremonies of the Jews</i>, intended for children and adults wanting to know
more and correct misunderstandings. Around that time, more English-language
treatises, instructions for ritual, and books on ethics and morality, were
published, with even rival Hebrew Bible translations! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In America, the Jewish settlers were also becoming
predominately English speakers, and they use Jewish writings in the English
language. Many of Levi's writings were reprinted in cities like Philadelphia,
and 19<sup>th</sup> century Jewish educators used the same materials English
Jewish educators used. The influence did not stop at books. For any and all
attempts to establish a different hegemony, like some German-born community
leaders and rabbis in 19<sup>th</sup> century America, these attempts did not
take root.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>"In a community where rabbis
played a relatively diminished role in shaping Jewish communal priorities,
where the intellectual legacy of European Jews . . .was hardly meaningful for
most Jews, and where the Jewish laity was asserting its right to adapt the
tradition as it saw fit, the American Jewish community looked more and more
like its English counterpart than its German one (Ruderman, 272)." </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because the translators felt there were few equivalents in
the English language for many Jewish concepts in Hebrew, they left them as is,
often with English definitions. This resulted in another explosion of Hebrew
loanwords. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word chasid itself is an interesting doublet. In
Wycliff's translation of the Bible, 'assidian' was the name given to the
followers of the Macabees, who "defended the purity of their worship against
the attempts of Antiochus Epiphanes to introduce idolatry," according to the
OED. It was later used in 1834 to refer to members of a Jewish sect seeking an
intimate connection with God. PDE now knows them as chasids or 'chasidim.' Both
came from the Hebrew 'h&#259;s&#299;d&#299;m,' meaning 'holy ones, saints.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beth Din is Hebrew, meaning 'house of judgment.' Interesting
enough, the OED has quotations from a law book and two newspapers ("Should the
proceedings of London's Jewish House of Judgment--the Beth-Din--be kept
secret," asked the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sunday Dispatch</i> in
1928).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I cannot attempt a brief history of Yiddish, nor will I try.
It is sufficient to say Yiddishisms entered the English language, mostly among
Jewish immigrants to America from Eastern Europe, but also to England. Most of
them have either Hebrew or German roots, but some are from the Slavic
languages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Oxford English Dictionary says mamzer was actually
"adopted by the Vulgate in Deut. xxiii. 2 (where it appears with the gloss 'id
est de scorto natus'), and hence frequently used in the Middle Ages." It
entered Yiddish, and re-entered the English language as a slang term for "one
who borrows frequently, or who expects much attention and many favors; a
sponger... Any disliked person; a bastard," according to Wentworth in 1960.
Rosten has it as "often used to describe a very bright child, a clever or
ingenious person, a resourceful, gets-things-done, corner-cutting type" in
1968. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shamash (from the Hebrew root 'shimmesh,' 'to serve') did
enter in 1650, along with Chilmead's other words. However, it is best known as
from the Yiddish 'shames.' That word appears in not only Judaism-specific
writings, but also religious texts. Tochus is slang for the backside, and is
originally from Yiddish, from the Hebrew root 'tahat,' 'underneath.' Shidduch
is also Yiddish from Hebrew (root 'shidduk,' 'courtship, arranged marriage').</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meshuga is Yiddish, and has its roots in Hebrew and German
words. The Hebrew 'm&#277;shugg&#257;'' is a particle of 'sh&#257;gag', meaning
'to go astray, wander,' and is also related to the German meschugge meaning
'crazy.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The meaning of schmooze has ameorilized from the Hebrew
root, 'sh&#277;m&#363;'ah,' a word meaning 'rumor.' The Hebrew became 'shmues,'
'to chat or gossip,' and generally means a pleasant, long, intimate chat with
someone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Jewish education was written in English, a concurrent
revolution sought to make Hebrew a language for secular as well as religious
matters. A major text on Israeli history and Hebrew change, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Language and Revolution</i> notes five
aliyas, the first happening in 1881. With each successive new immigrant to
Palestine, new words came in English. Often, these words were not only names of
settling organizations, but things not found anywhere else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yishuv, meaning 'settlement,' was used for Jewish
communities in Palestine from the 19<sup>th</sup> century to 1948.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Poale Zion, meaning 'workers of Zion,' if you have not
guessed, is a left-wing Zionist labor organization founded in 1899 in Russia.
Hadassah, the Hebrew name of Biblical Esther, "An American Zionist women's
organization, founded in 1912, which contributes to welfare work in Israel."
Sabra is a native Israeli, from the Hebrew word for a prickly pear. Sabra is
one of the many English words that come from a metaphor. Not surprisingly, it
appeared around 1948. Pita is Greek, Turkish, and Hebrew and different variants
appeared around the same time. The Greek variant meant 'bread, cake, or pie,'
but the meaning has narrowed to thick and flat bread found in Mediterranean and
Middle Eastern foods. Aliyah was used in 1933 in the group Youth Aliyah, for
the emigration of young Jews to Palestine, and then to any travel or move to
Israel (from Hebrew, 'ascent'). Kibbutz is a Modern Hebrew word for
'gathering,' and its meaning has narrowed to mean a large farming collective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will examine the words that had recently entered English,
and implications. The three words I found had to do with three different
trends: Liberal Judaism delving into more specific rather than universal
concepts and forming new rituals; Traditional Judaism asserting itself through
its own writings; and interchange and dialogue between the two. A history of
denominations of American Judaism would take a paper in its self, but the
discussion on just what is religion (especially with most Christian scholarship
focusing on understanding of shared tradition rather than supersession)
supposed to do has contributed so new loanwords, and helped push more of the
Hebrew word or phrase being preferred over the English. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shabbat is the Sephardic pronunciation and spelling of
'sabbat.' While 'sabbath' (used instead of 'dias Saturni' in Bible translation)
entered the language much sooner, when Sephardic pronunciation of Hebrew became
the norm for secular and religious works, Shabbat was used more in
Judaism-specific writings. It first entered in 1934. Shabbos is the Yiddish
spelling and pronunciation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bat Mitzvah ('daughter of the covenant') was based on Bar
Mitzvah ('son of the covenant'), and if I remember right, was introduced by
Mordecai Kaplan for Reform congregations. The word itself entered English in
1950.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kippah, a skullcap worn by Orthodox male Jews, and by male
Jews on religious occasions, is in semantic competition with the Yiddish word
for the head covering, 'yarmulke,' an older word (Yiddish derived from the
Polish 'jarmulka'). Kippah entered in 1964, while yarmulke entered 1903.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perhaps the biggest example of a concept that goes from
being translated into the English equivalent to having its own word is
tzedakah. Before 1959, it would have just been translated into 'charity,'
'righteousness' (the literal translation of the Hebrew) or 'helping other
Jews.' Now, the whole word, tzedakah, is used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With all this new information, it is easy to lose
prospective of just what these changes are. Let us look at the word the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Forward</i> mentioned as a premier Biblical
Hebrew loanword, 'Sabbath.' It is also a great example of English language
change brought on by Yiddish and Modern Hebrew. Shabbat is the Sephardic
pronunciation and spelling of 'sabbat.' While 'sabbath' (used instead of 'dias
Saturni' in Bible translation) entered the language much sooner, when Sephardic
pronunciation of Hebrew became the norm for secular and religious works,
Shabbat was used more in Judaism-specific writings, while text for Christian or
Jewish and Christian audiences use Sabbath. It first entered in 1934. Shabbos
is the Yiddish spelling and pronunciation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For now, it seems that Hebrew loanwords have stopped coming
into the English language. Perhaps, with changes in Jewish religious practice
(for instance, outreach to people interested in converting and interest in
adoption and in-vitro fertilization) and in Israeli politics (the recent
'troubles') may introduce new loanwords to better describe the situation. Maybe
also, other languages will adopt Hebrew loanwords and introduce them into
English by that route. Time, and a new version of the OED, will tell.</p>
