<P>
Perhaps Sign Guy should have his own web page too.  He's the reason I
started taking pictures in the first place.  Did you hear about the time
last May when he appeared in successive weeks in his angel costume, mumbling
about the apocalypse, and bringing props each time?  One week it was a
trumpet of the sort you get at football games (but he just didn't have the
lungs to make much noise with it), then he brought a toy plastic sword and
made slashing motions with it.  Finally he appeared with his face, robe, and
a toy sickle all covered with stage blood!  (Making some point, I guess,
about a final harvest of souls?  It was hard to tell what his point was,
above the hooting laughter).

<P>
It was only the following week that I brought the camera for the first time.
I also invested in some toy weapons and stage blood of my own (from Jack's
Joke Shop, on Boylston Avenue) so that a little militia of us scoffers could
be ready for him next time.  That explains the picture of Neuf with the
cleaver that you scanned.  Sadly Sign Guy didn't show then, and never
obliged us again with such regular appearances or pantomimic weirdness (just
occasional sign-carrying in ordinary clothes).  Until lately.

<P>
You saw him last week.  He came again this week, when you weren't here.  He
did the same scribbling routine, getting little attention.  After he
disappeared a while, and Corbin finished his rant, he came back wearing a
baker's hat and brandishing a pumpernickel bagel.  (A costume change!
Impressive.)  I didn't catch it all, but the point of his mumbling this time
was that God was hardening our hearts.  Like a stale bagel, were we to
infer?  Chuck drove him off with shouts of "Bad metaphor!  Bad metaphor!"
But he wasn't finished.  He came back yet again, with cables wrapped around
his wrists and ankles, this time making some point about our bondage to sin.
We were actually a bit concerned for the poor fool, that he'd stumble and
hit his head, so Bill (you know, the young Army guy) got out his pliers, one
of those many-in-one tools that he carries everywhere, and tried to cut the
cable as I shouted, "The truth will set you free!" but Sign Guy wiggled away
and managed to extricate himself.

<P>
I got pictures this time.  You should scan some more of him.  I sincerely
hope that the weirdness continues.  Perhaps our unintentional young comedian
is getting over his stage fright.
