<li>Q: Who is Pastor Corbin?<p>
A: Pastor Gary W. Corbin is a preacher that comes around every Saturday 
night at 10:30 pm (he is not always on time, but he gets there). He does what 
most street preachers do--read out-of-context Bible quotes that basically 
state "Worship Jesus or go to hell!" Unfortunately for him, he rarely gets a 
responsive audience. In fact, they yell comebacks at him and his insanity.<p>
<li>Q: Where is he from, Alabama or something?<p>
A: No, no, no, he's from South Boston. You hear right--not the American South,
 but South Boston. He has his own church there, with a total congretation of 
twenty-five. You can imagine how he feels about the Irish Catholics there.<p> 
<li>Q: There are a bunch of religious wackies on Harvard Square, from the Hare
 Krishnas, to the drug dealer with the "Repent Jesus Is Coming" sign, to the 
Memmonites to Jews for Jesus. What makes him so special?<p>
A: Well, the others usually just hand out tracts and books and mind their own 
business. Those that don't at the very least speak at a reasonable vocal
level. But Pastor Corbin  is <em>special</em>. He has been doing this for
years. Also, HE SHOUTS REAL LOUD. <i>Someone</i> must've blessed him with
the vocal cords of an opera singer.<p>
<li>Q: <em>How</em> long has he been doing this?<p>
A: The conservative estimate is ten years, some say fifteen. After five, 
most fundie wackies would decide to get away from the Moscow on the Charles 
and take their ministry to prisons. Not Pastor Corbin! He keeps on coming back, despite all the insults. By exposure to the 
Bible, those heathens will come around and be born-again! Yes, and the Easter 
Bunny exist. In the old days, or so I'm told, there were pockets of debate 
going on between different preachers and heathens into the very late night. 
But time and an 11:30 curfew put an end to it. But the Pastor is still here 
and so are we. Debates still happen up until midnight.<p>
<li>Q: What sect of Christianity is he?<p>
A: As a (ex-)darling of mine once observed, every street preacher is his own
sect of Christianity :). But seriously, he is idenitifed as hellfire and 
brimstone Southern Baptist. Yep, the genuine article<p>
<li>Q: How did "Preacherfest" get started?<p>
A: Well, Cambridge has a good-size population  of atheists, pagans, agnostics,
 hetreodox Jews, and other non-fundies. It wasn't before long before the 
atheists (according to Jeff) got wind of his preaching and started making fun of
his preaching. Freaks, punks, tourists, slumming students, and
not-so-innocent bystanders started coming to the area to particpate and watch.
 Thus, Preacherfest was born.<p>   
<li>Q: What do people do there?<p>
A: Sarcastic responses to verses, out-of-context movie quotes, suggestions to 
lay off the caffeine and use breath freshners, strange non-sequitors, signs, songs, an occasional 
Krrris-chun testimonial, theological debates, and general performance art. 
More info is found in the Preacherfest log, found 
<a href="log.html">in here</a>.<p>
<li>Q: Is it just him doing this?<p>
A: Oh no! He has his two daughters, one son, and some random guy
from his church helping him out. Yes, yes, it is frightening.<p> 
<li>Q: He has a church?!<P>
A: Uh huh. It's called the Bible Baptist Church, 330 E Street, South 
Boston. The total congretation is 25. I can imagine his envy everytime 
he looks at the Gate of Heaven (a Catholic church) on Sundays.<p>
<li>Q: How do you get to Preacherfest?<p>
A: By train: Take the Red Line to Harvard Square Station. Go to the street 
level and wait by the white elevator. From the commuter rail, 
go to South Station to get to the Red Line. From the Green Line and Blue Line, 
go to Park Street. From the Orange Line, go to Downtown Crossing.<p>
By car: Uhhh, frankly, get there by way of Boston, go to Cambridge, and go 
down Massachusetts Ave, until you get to JFK Street and Harvard Square Station.
<p>
<li>Reading materials<p>
If you're there, get whatever tracks you can. Not only the cheap pamphelets, 
but the atheist and Temple of Cthluhu tracts. Have a good laugh over all of 
them.<p>
