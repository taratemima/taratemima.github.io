Artemis and Actaeon

<P>
She beheld a man<BR>
with a big gun<BR>
hunting a small deer.

<P>
Disgusting.

<P>
She was a hunter too,<BR>
but hers was <BR>
a challenge of equals--<BR>
a goddess <BR>
with a bow, arrow, sight, quickness<BR>
versus<BR>
an animal with <BR>
instincts of blood, fangs, speed, claws.

<P>
Disrepectful.

<P>
She knew what he did--<BR>
she knew whose trust he violated.<BR>
Broken hearts of lovers and family,<BR>
men and women.

<P>
Dishonorable.

<P>
And now see this carrion <BR>
not even food for humans--<BR>
fit only for crows.

<P>
Waste.

<P>
The man walked without heed,<BR>
searching for the next deer--<BR>
this is like channel-surfing to him.

<P>
*What's happening*,<BR>
he thought as his knuckles grew hairier,
hands became paws,<BR>
nails became claws,<BR>
and his bulk and fur tore his clothes.

<P>
He screamed like a human but it came out a wail of a bear.

<P>
And that's when his hunting buddies,<BR>
all liquored up,<BR>
turned and shot him.
