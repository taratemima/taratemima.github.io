Don't Follow<p>

sometime in the future . . .
<p>
"Say goodbye don't follow"
<p>
Cartons of spareribs and fries scatter all over the table.<br>
Me and he are watching the sun go down,<br>
staining his hands red.<p>

I ask so many questions, he said--<br>
are you all right, taking your Zoloft?<br>
how is your job, settled accounts?<p>

Why doesn't *he* ask the questions--<br>
do you love me (oh, god, as a friend), <br>
are you moving yet (someday soon)?<br>
packed your bags yet (I want to, but . . .),<br>
thrown away my photos yet (never)?<p>

I hope he doesn't but I wish he would.<p>

He gets a glass of water and his bottle<br>
it's time for his Ritalin--<br>
I don't take mine until eight tonight.<p>

I will miss his wolfish eyes.<br>
He will miss my habit of blushing easily.<br>
During dinner we were alone.<br>
After, we will be even more alone.<p>

"Read the page it's cold<br>
And dead<br>
<p>
Take me home" 
<p>
The first and last lines were from Alice In Chain's "Don't Follow." The phrase 
came to mind, I wrote the poem, looked at the song, and took it from there.
