<BODY>
<P>
Frank's coat was too big for him. The bottom was wrinkled, and the cuffs 
covered his shirt and extended into the lower palms. This coat was made for a 
bigger man than Frank, but it was clean and professional and he didn't want to 
spend any more of his meager savings than he needs to.

<P>
Sara's illness drained his energy, his medical insurance, and his 
earnings. When she died, what little strength he had was gone too. Sometimes, he
would be too tired to do anything other than the minimal at his job. He didn't 
lose his job, thank God. He had, however, a large amount of debt from the 
funeral. Standing on the train now, he kept thinking of the prayer shawl he put
gently on her small shoulders. Her closed eyes and her soft red mouth, made
into a smile, kept coming back. She was wearing a wig of dark brown hair,
as curly and thick as it used to be before chemotherapy.

<P>
"I should cry, but I can't," he thought as the doors open to South 
Station. He joined the morning rush crowd on the street, not really noticing
anything. 
<P>
He bumped into an old man carrying several bags. Muttering an apology,
he moved on, hoping that he hasn't missed his train.
